This should get investors who have been sitting on the fence (as some thought Ryzen would have only been a stop-gap or temporary success) to now go long the stock.

The string of numbers indicates a GPU with 700MHz base clocks and 1.3GHz boost clocks. Given the rumored 704 cores for Raven Ridge, those clocks would mean 1.83TFLOPs. Considering that the GPU architecture used is Vega, we can assume a performance similar to today's AMD Radeon RX 460 discrete desktop GPU. This is just an engineering sample so final clocks and performance could be even higher. Such performance for an APU would significantly raise the bar for what lower-end discrete GPUs must offer, shrinking the segment for Nvidia. Using advanced packaging to pair a CPU die with a GPU die would allow for even more performance, further reducing the TAM for Nvidia while creating opportunities for AMD.", "Must also note that a 1.83 TFLOPs GPU for Raven Ridge would absolutely obliterate Intel's current integrated GPUs in performance while offering a great experience in multiplayer online games like Dota 2 or League of Legends. Compared to AMD's current offerings, their integrated GPUs would practically double in gaming performance.", "Takeaway", "Very interesting developments that will create substantial upside for AMD, enabling higher attach rates for AMD's GPUs as well as significant share gains. At the same time, Raven Ridge with such a potent GPU would be very appealing in markets like China where multiplayer online games are extremely popular.", "For Nvidia it would be a significant blow but not a disaster.

Today total liabilities of AMD are $2.9 billion. Cash levels this quarter were $1.26 billion vs $1 billion back in 2014. Yes things are getting better, but in terms of total liabilities they are not that much better.", "Also note something else, the lower liabilities are not the product of internal generated profits.

My question is why is the market so happy with this result? While I did not have an estimate myself, I was expecting a whole lot more in EPS than one penny folks.", "AMD has a lower debt load, a lower interest expense, and it's also receiving licensing income from their server JV. Despite all this, AMD still can't make money.", "Either AMD still does not have pricing power, or it's spending too much money in the day-to-day operations of the company, or both.", "Either way, in my mind, even if AMD's revenue increases at a healthy double-digit pace for 2017 and 2018, unless we also see increased profitability, thee are not many reasons for the stock to rise from this point.", "Also, I was disappointed that the company is not able to provide EPS guidance for the next quarter. I understand it's very difficult for the entire year, however I do not understand why it's that difficult for the next quarter.", "Like I said, in the past I used INTC and NVDA as a comparison to try to guess how high AMD might go.

AMD was trading a such a huge discount to revenue compared to INTC that I forecasted it would be a multi-bagger stock when the market finally realized the company is not going out of business.", "Well that has happened so far, however please also note that under no circumstances does AMD have the right to trade as high as INTC on a revenue basis.", "First of all, INTC is highly profitable and has a P/E. AMD is barely profitable, and is not expected to be anywhere near as profitable as INTC anytime soon. Also, INTC pays a dividend, whereas in AMD's case, a dividend is nowhere on the horizon. Finally, INTC is buying back shares, AMD has been selling shares.", "So in my mind, on a price to revenue basis, AMD does not deserve to trade anywhere near INTC. Yes the current run in the stock is warranted because of the balance sheet adjustment (for the most part), however in order for AMD to trade much higher, we also have to see actual profitability. And I am not talking several pennies, but at least something north of $0.50 per share.", "While the rise in AMD shares over the past year is warranted, I am cautious as to the reasons for a continued rise.", "AMD is still not profitable, and I think it needs further balance sheet adjustments. Until profitability returns, that will be difficult to achieve.", "AMD is approaching INTC on a price/sales metric. I do not think this is justified. INTC is much more profitable, pays a dividend and has a stronger balance sheet.", "My sense is that AMD shares are continuing to rise on a market sugar high. However please note that both sugar-highs and rally overshoots end at some point.", "Consider selling AMD when you see a bearish technical chart."]},
