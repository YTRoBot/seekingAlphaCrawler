"Ever since it reported quarterly earnings, shares of, (, ) slumped by nearly 20 percent. The stock is in danger of failing to get back to the $11 - $12 price range. Downgrades from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Barclays back in the summer, only worsened the stock’s performance. While the under-performance is understandable (AMD stock is up more than five-fold in the last two years), investment houses will profit from AMD falling lower., 11/15/2017, 173,104,624, 57,639,528, 3.00323, 10/31/2017, 154,971,369, 74,136,653, 2.09035, 10/13/2017, 148,604,154, 46,844,493, 3.17229, 9/29/2017, 160,535,237, 75,123,173, 2.13696, 9/15/2017, 158,109,563, 45,816,464, 3.45093, 8/31/2017, 149,045,759, 43,684,491, 3.41187, Source:, Short float rose dramatically between Oct. 31 and Nov. 15, going up by nearly 20 million shares, or a trading volume of $2 billion. Bears grabbed onto a lack of IP revenue in Q3. They are capitalizing on CEO Lisa Su’s earnings conservative forecast for the fourth quarter and for the year. AMD expects:, Revenue falling 15% Q/Q but up 26% Y/Y, 2017 annual revenue up 20% Y/Y, up from prior guidance of mid- to high-teens percentage growth Pushback in semi-custom business outside of console, with ramp up in 2H/2018. Consumer block chain will level off in Q4 but commercial block chain will grow EPYC will be sizable portion of total revenue in 2018., AMD’s tempered expectations for cryptocurrency mining puts the company’s at odds with Mizuho’s contention that both AMD and Nvidia (, ) are, primarily on it. AMD put significant efforts in getting the scalable chip launched before Intel (NASDAQ:, ) could refresh its PCs. With the under-performance in AMD stock, few investors believe EPYC’s ramp into 2018 will add to the bottom line., AMD not only won many design wins during the quarter but customers also are considering using EPYC for multiple platforms. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:, ) and Dell will likely put in small orders to validate the technology. If satisfied, shorts should beware. HPE and Dell will both deploy EPYC-based solutions to more customers in Q4 and in 2018. AMD said that Q4 is usually a seasonally weak period for semi-custom. But the strong ramp in new products will give revenue a bigger lift than initially thought., Despite its diminutive size, AMD’s EPYC may still take significant market share from Intel. Historically, in 2005/06, AMD’s Opteron chip gave the company around 25% – 30% of the chip market. Similar to EPYC, Opteron differentiates itself to Intel’s offering. The first-generation Zen-based EPYC chip has a strong core performance, more cores, and is very balanced. Unlike the Opteron launch, which lost its momentum in successive years, AMD has a product roadmap ready. Zen 2 and Zen 3 already are in production, with AMD already committing to its R&D staff. For the time being, the current EPYC solution has more memory, I/O, and bandwidth to meet even the most demanding customer. In four to five quarters, AMD aims to have around 25 percent of the market share in the long term., The EBITDA multiples model suggests that AMD stock is fairly valued at current levels. Per finbox.io, this technique (also known as comparable companies analysis) compares operating metrics and valuation multiples of similar public companies to determine a value for the subject company. Benchmark companies used to arrive at AMD’s fair value are, (, ), and, (, ). AMD’s profit margin of 5.2 percent lags the sector average of 8.7%., This is typical for a company that is in the beginning phases of a multi-year turnaround:, Source:, AMD is fairly valued now, only because the company has yet to report higher profit margins. This will come in the next four to eight quarters. Impatient investors will yield to bears by selling the stock now instead of waiting for the upside to come later. Investors looking beyond 2017 will get rewarded as revenue from EPYC, Ryzen, Polaris, and semi-custom solutions accelerate., Please, me for continued coverage on value stocks on sale.

"In an October article (, ), we updated the final performance on our hedged portfolio from April that included an Advanced Micro Devices (, ) position. We noted there that we had exited our AMD position up 7.8%, and the portfolio as a whole closed up 26.38%., A few days later, we created an, for AMD. Since then, AMD shares are down nearly 30%., AMD investors who were hedged fared better, as we illustrate below. We close by discussing courses of action for hedged AMD longs now., As of October 24th's close, this was the optimal, or least expensive, collar to hedge 1,000 shares of AMD against a greater than 15% drop by late April, while not capping an investor's upside at less than 12% by the end of that time period. We used a 12% cap here, because that was the highest cap percent at which you could eliminate the positive hedging cost., As you can see at the bottom of the second screen capture above, the cost was negative, so an investor would have collected an amount equal to $350, or 2.46% of position value when opening this collar, assuming he placed both trades at the worst ends of their respective spreads., The idea behind this hedge was that the investor could tolerate a decline of 15% but no more than that. Let's see where you'd be had you hedged then and held through Wednesday's close., Here's an updated quote on the put leg as of Wednesday's close, via, :, And here is an updated quote on the call leg:, AMD closed at $14.25 on Tuesday, October 24th. A shareholder who owned 1,000 shares of it and hedged with the collar above then had $14,250 in AMD shares plus $950 in puts, and if he wanted to buy-to-close his short call leg, he would have needed to pay $1,300 to do that. So, his net position value on October 24th was ($14,250 + $950) - $1,300 = $13,900., AMD closed at $10 on Wednesday, December 6th, down about 29.8% from its closing price on December 6th. The investor's shares were worth $10,000 as of 12/6, his put options were worth $2,570, and if he wanted to close out the short call leg of his collar, it would have cost him $180, using the midpoint of the spread, in both cases. So: ($10,000 + $2,570) - $180 = $12,390. $12,390 represents a 10.9% drop from $13,900., So, although AMD had dropped by about 30% at the time of the calculations above, and the investor's hedge was designed to limit him to a loss of no more than 15%, he was actually down less than 11% on his combined net hedge plus underlying stock position by this point. This is an example of the impact of time value on a hedge designed to protect based on its intrinsic value alone., If you're hedged with the collar above, it doesn't expire until April, so you have time to feel this out, while your downside is strictly limited. If the stock drops further, but you remain bullish on it, you might consider buying-to-close the call leg of the collar to eliminate your upside cap. If you're confident AMD has bottomed, you could even sell your appreciated put options and use the proceeds to buy more AMD shares here. Options can give you options., , , I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

"One difference between smart money and the average investor is that the average investor invests with emotion and headline news, while the smart money invests based on valuation., (, ) reported a, that beat consensus by a mile. Revenue for Q3 came in at $2.64B that was up by 32% Y/Y, however the impressive thing is that it beat by a whopping $280M, which is over 10% of total revenue (if you did not notice). In addition, EPS came in at $1.33, which beat the street by an impressive $0.26 per share., However, despite the impressive beat, NVDA shares have plunged recently. How can this be so? The answer is because sometimes even a great quarter and then some already is baked into the stock price. In fact, in my opinion, everything good that could happen to NVDA over the next decade is probably backed in the stock already., As long-time readers know, I consider NVDA a massive bubble. As far as I'm concerned, the numbers speak for themselves. Even after the current correction, NVDA has a trailing P/E of 55 and a forward 12-month P/E of 40., Furthermore it's trading at a mind-boggling 13 times revenue. And that's even after the recent correction., So the reason why NVDA has corrected, even after the recent fantastic quarter, is that everything (and then some) already is discounted in the stock., But wait, you're going to tell me that NVDA has been a very expensive stock for a while now, and that it deserves to be this rich because of its growth., That's simply what many want to believe to persuade themselves that they made a good bet and made good money with NVDA, and not because they are lucky., And the reason most investors were lucky (institutional investors included) is because this market has not corrected for a very long time, and the P/E expansion in many stocks has taken on a new meaning in cases like in NVDA. Outside of that, there's no reason NVDA should be trading this rich., In the case of, ), the correction has to do with too much hype, not enough profits, and an increase in the outstanding share count that no one has been noticing., Sure AMD has prospects, but these prospects already are baked into its stock price from last year. That's right, over and over again investors do not seem to want to understand that there are cases where stocks jump ahead of themselves, because people want to become rich fast., Back in February when AMD was trading at about $13 a share I told you that the rally in AMD was on borrowed time, however no one wanted to listen (please consider:, ). In fact, I also told you to sell AMD and buy, (, ) (please consider:, ). My timing is not perfect, however longer term this thesis played out., And do you now why it played out? Because AMD was too rich in valuation, and INTC too cheap. It's as simple that. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to figure it out., But analysts currently have a $14 price target, you say. Yes, they do, but do you remember what their price target was, when the stock was rallying when I was fully loaded (up to my neck) in AMD shares? Let me remind you because I have saved a print screen for such an occasion., That's right folks, when AMD was rallying and was already at $4 a share, analysts still had an average price target of $2.28. Don't get me wrong, the average analyst consensus is usually right. However there are times when they get it all wrong., And the reason is simple: AMD started flying and they had to upgrade their targets in order to save face. And when AMD became a very popular trading stock, then they competed between each other for which analyst will have the highest price target., Today we are at the opposite. The stock has not gone anywhere for about a year, but they still think AMD will go to the moon (as suggested by many investors). But when AMD was trading at $2 a share, I was one of the few telling you to buy., And the same thing applies to NVDA as well. Analysts in both stocks are competing who will have the highest price target, no matter how stretched valuations are., And if AMD reaches $6 a share over the next several months (a good probability mind you), then there will be a race to lower price targets. But it will be after the plunge already happened., AMD has gone nowhere for the better part of 2017. And if you want my interpretation of the above chart (weekly time scale), I think AMD will head lower before it sees news highs. How low is difficult to say. However I would not rule out even $6 a share in a general market correction., NVDA's chart is not as bad as AMD's, and in fact the long-term uptrend is still intact. However in the recent pullback NVDA retracted almost 20%. Let me remind that a 20% correction is a sign of weakness, and a sign that a stock's long-term trend might be coming to an end., Personally I would sell both stocks if I had them, and if you have a talent at shorting, I would put them on your watchlist., When everyone says something will happen, or everyone cheers for higher price targets, it usually happens. Yes, self-fulfilling prophesies most of the time play out., However there are times that even when every analyst on the street is cheering, the market will not listen., Because after a certain point valuations come into play. And no matter what analysts say, the market will simply not follow. It is my belief that this is the case for both AMD and NVDA at the current time. Even self-fulfilled prophecies have their limits., , , I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

"It is commonly discussed that Advanced Micro Devices (, ) has finally returned to the market as a real competitor to the likes of Intel (, ) and Nvidia (, ). Hence, the company launched several comprehensive products in the CPU and GPU segments in 2017, such as Ryzen, Epyc, and Vega. The success of the products even helped the corporation record its first operating profit in three years in Q3 2017. Notably, the stock reacted negatively, dropping about 30% since the middle of October., While certain risks still remain for the company, AMD has recently been able to establish several promising collaborations. I believe these partnerships will be able to boost such important for AMD segments as Computing and Graphics and Semi-Custom. As a result, the stock will likely to return to growth, and the current level can be considered as a moment to invest in the company or increase the position. This is supported by the fact the current price represents less than 17x EBITDA exit multiple, according to my DCF model, which is too conservative for AMD., During the last two months, AMD has been able to grow its list of partners, and now it includes such names as Intel, Microsoft (, ), and Qualcomm (, )., In the beginning of November, AMD, it would collaborate with Intel to bring a new Core chip to the market with AMD Radeon graphics inside. The product will be aimed at a portable PC market, and I believe it is possible the new chip will power some game consoles in the future. While the partnership between two rivals sounds strange, it is claimed the new chip will start shipping in Q1 2018., In my, on this topic, I explained why this collaboration will be beneficial for both Intel and AMD. Thus, Intel will be able to provide a new powerful product to compete with Nvidia's Max-Q, while AMD will gain from Intel's distribution network, also increasing its revenue from Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment., Notably, AMD's management claimed earlier this year that the segment does not demonstrate significant growth due to decreasing semi-custom business. The main reason for this is the fact that the current console cycle is in its fifth year, which is why certain saturation point was likely achieved. It was stated during, :, In our semi-custom business, unit shipments were up sequentially and down year-over-year as we enter the fifth year of the current game console sales cycle. This console cycle continues to outpace previous cycles as Sony recently passed a milestone of 60 million PlayStation 4 consoles shipped., An important point here is that the semi-custom business seemed to be one of the weak points of the corporation over at least last two quarters. In turn, in the coming future, we can expect the change in the situation, due to the partnership with Intel and the release of Xbox One X, the most powerful game console in the market. Thus, Intel is a viable partner for AMD, with more than $60 billion in annual revenue and strong ties in the industry, while early sales figures of Xbox One X, the console is blowing expectations. Therefore, it will be important to watch closely the developments in this segment of AMD's business: if the revenue for Semi-Custom returns to growth in Q4 2017 and Q1 2018 on a YoY basis (which I find to be very likely), we can expect AMD's overall results will continue beating expectations., On December 5, AMD unveiled two more promising collaborations., one is with Qualcomm., AMD today announced that they are working with Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. to bring smooth and fast PC connectivity solutions to AMD’s high-performance Ryzen™ mobile processors, featuring the world’s fastest processor for ultrathin notebooks., The project is aimed to offer PC makers a new solution for ""Always Connected"" computers. Hence, it is stated OEMs will be able to combine the best solutions from the two chipmakers: AMD Ryzen mobile processors with Radeon Vega graphics and Qualcomm Snapdragon LTE modem. This will help OEMs ""achieve new levels of performance, connectivity, and capability for ultrathin notebook PCs,” ensuring long battery life, fast performance for gaming, and high download speed via LTE. It should be noted AMD, its Ryzen mobile chips featuring integrated Vega graphics on a, piece of silicon in October. It is claimed the processors offer ""desktop level of performance"" while having a small footprint for thin and light laptops., Therefore, it is seen that AMD takes the portable PC market seriously, as both AMD-Qualcomm and AMD-Intel collaborations are targeted at this segment. I believe AMD will gain from the partnership with Qualcomm significantly, taking a solid position in the mobile PC market. Again, QCOM's huge revenues and reputation (not to say fame) will provide a viable ""assistance"" to the upcoming AMD-QCOM product. Moreover, as Microsoft is really focused on developing this market, it can be expected the tech giant will provide significant marketing support for AMD's solution, which is important in light of AMD's tight margins. As a result, the growth in Computing and Graphics segment will likely continue to be in the double-digit range., The market for always connected PCs is relatively new, but it has already been seen that such corporations as Microsoft and Intel are keen on developing this segment. Hence, Intel and Microsoft are, such features as instant waking and fast LTE are going to appear on most notebooks in 2018, and this will not necessarily be achieved by ARM processors. AMD-Qualcomm collaboration confirms this view successfully., Intel and AMD have both been keen to highlight that you don't, an ARM processor for this kind of connectivity—and you might not need one for the other claimed ARM advantages either., Microsoft lists such features of modern standby (which is a part of the ""Always Connected"" philosophy) as waking on voice for using Cortana, receiving Skype calls, and other., (, ), There are still things which are unknown about the product. The most important, from my point of view, are the pricing strategy and estimated addressable market. As AMD will compete with similar solutions from Intel, it is possible the corporation will try to win the price war in the segment, sacrificing its margins, as the company has done so far. However, it seems that this time AMD is able to offer a superior product from early on, thus gaining initial market power faster, which should encourage investors., The second announcement was related to Microsoft Azure. It was revealed Azure would become the ""first global cloud provider to deploy AMD EPYC,"" as Microsoft Azure is deploying AMD’s EPYC processors in its L-Series of Virtual Machines for storage optimized workloads. This represents a significant milestone for AMD, as EPYC processor is the, major attempt of the company to ""crack the Intel-dominated server CPU business."", The importance of the server business for AMD's future was discussed in one of my previous, on AMD. In short, the management aims at about 10% market share in the data center industry, which would represent about $2.1 billion in revenue for the corporation on the first stages. This would represent about 50% increase in revenues from the level of 2016. Moreover, it is, the global server market will grow at about 14.5% CAGR in the next 4 years, which makes the industry even more attractive for AMD., It is interesting to note that while Intel, that EPYC chips are not better than the tech giant's Xeon processor, some estimations reveal that AMD is more superior in terms of energy consumption. As this issue is crucial for datacenters, it can be expected EPYC will gain significant traction in the near future., While the announcement itself was not unexpected (Microsoft revealed its intent regarding EPYC processors at the launch), the partnership represents the first real example of EPYC's success. Moreover, this provides certain confidence to investors regarding EPYC's future in the server market, as similar partnerships will likely result in long-term collaborations., The new offering is based on a close collaboration between the two companies on Microsoft’s Project Olympus—an open source cloud hardware design that Microsoft says will be a springboard for additional future instances utilizing EPYC processors. It's clear that the companies are setting their collaboration up to continue to bear fruit in the coming years—if the LV2-Series and subsequent instances are a success, it should do much to further build out ecosystem confidence in EPYC., Despite all the recent announcements regarding promising collaborations, AMD stock has declined sharply over last month. It is difficult to evaluate what are the exact reasons for this, but certain risks can explain the price behavior., For instance, some analysts predict that crypto mining will decrease next year, while the segment itself provided a significant tailwind to AMD. As a result, Morgan Stanley (, ) downgraded the share price target from $11 to $8. Joseph Moore, an analyst at the bank,, in the report:, We believe that AMD’s graphics surge has been caused by a sharp increase in sales of graphics chips to cryptocurrency miners. We expect this to meaningfully decelerate next year., While the concerns related to the crypto currency market remain, it is impossible to evaluate how much did the company earn from this boom. Moreover, with the price of bitcoin surging more than 100% over the last month, it is likely the crypto mining will not decrease in the near future., Another possible reason is the concern related to the GPU market. Thus, Nvidia has been, to increase its market share in the segment by ""a huge margin compared to AMD."" It is claimed AMD's GPU market share has decreased by 0.2% from the last quarter, reaching the level of 13%, whereas discrete GPU market share, from 30% to 27%. Notably, Computing and Graphics segment accounts for about 50% of the company's revenue, which makes GPU segment crucial for AMD's future., (, ), Additionally, many sources, AMD's Q3 results and Q4 guidance to be disappointing, as the corporation expects sequential revenue drop of 15% in Q4. These concerns seem to be strange due to a couple of reasons. Firstly, in Q3, AMD beat on both metrics significantly, demonstrating revenue growth of hefty 25.2% year-over-year, way above analysts' expectations. The growth was seen in almost all segments (the issue with the Semi-Custom business was explained earlier). Secondly, the corporation guided revenue growth for Q4 to be above consensus, also increasing the management's initial growth estimations from ""mid to high teens"" to ""over 20%."" A sequential drop looks to be irrelevant to me, as the similar situation has been observed over at least four years already. Therefore, it is clear earnings could not justify the current price behavior: a 30% drop in share price after the earnings beat and raise of guidance seem to be odd., Overall, it is seen that AMD has been rather successful in establishing several promising partnerships over last months. Hence, the list of partners now includes such big names as Intel, Qualcomm, and Microsoft, which should positively impact AMD's position in the market, increasing revenues for such segments as Computing and Graphics and Semi-Custom., While ADM stock has decreased sharply since Q3 earnings report, it can be expected the trend is likely to change in the near future. In 2018, the company will get a boost from the products designed in collaboration with Intel, and the company's EPYC and Ryzen chips should gain significant traction., In addition, the price drop provides a much better margin of safety, as AMD forward EV/EBITDA decreased from hefty 35 to more reasonable 26. Additionally, the current price represents less than 17x EBITDA exit multiple, according to my DCF model provided in one of my previous, . This level looks to be rather conservative, especially for the corporation from the semiconductor industry., However, cautious investors should note that the current stock price is still only justified by the future performance, which is why it is necessary to watch closely the dynamics of the market., , , I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

"has rallied close to 740% between the first quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017. Since then, the stock is down 33% with a negative YTD performance of -11%. Is this trend going to continue going into 2018 or is this an interesting trade to add to your portfolio if you haven't already?, Before I go into any details, it is important to start by looking at the macroeconomic trends and the overall health of the computer & electronics industry. I did the same in my, , Let's start at the top and examine why tech has been doing so well since 2016. This question can be answered quite easily. The economy has bottomed in the first quarter of 2016 and started a massive acceleration in the third quarter - just one month prior to the election of President Trump. The graph below shows this economic trend quite well. Below you are looking at the leading ISM manufacturing index. This index tells us what we can expect in terms of economic growth over the next 1-3 months and has been very accurate (as it should) over the last few months., That being said, let's look at the computer & electronics industry. Below, I am comparing leading sentiment to the AMD stock price. This sentiment index has been built with the monthly ISM data that tell you how the growth ""situation"" is in every (non)-manufacturing industry., And in case you are wondering why this might work, let me show you the breakdown of the computer & electronics industry. Semiconductor and other electronic components are a large part of this industry and can therefore be compared to the computer & electronics sentiment., Now, with this in mind, let's look at the next graph that compares AMD's stock price to leading computer & electronics sentiment., Until 2016, AMD only managed to benefit from the earliest stages from a sentiment upswing. It has more or less been dead money except from quick short-term trades. The interesting thing is that AMD finally seems to catch up and deliver real value to investors. It is also a strong sign that computer & electronics sentiment stays very strong at elevated levels. And just to avoid confusion, it is the trend that counts. This sentiment indicator can go as high as 12 and as low as -12. Stocks on the other hand can go much higher (obviously). That's why it makes sense to use a year-on-year comparison as you can see below., What might look like the most useless graph in history is actually quite value-adding. AMD has lost all its momentum after catching up in 2016. The performance is back below zero which is a very interesting point to buy the stock in case sentiment stays high., $15 per share is a moderate price target in my opinion. However, this is depending on AMD's execution and success to grow revenues even further. So far, it is quite convincing considering that AMD has beaten earnings expectations every single time since the first quarter of 2016., Moreover, all major semiconductor companies were able to reach tremendous revenue growth numbers since the first quarter of 2016. Especially AMD turned double-digit contraction into what looks like sustainable double-digit growth., And this winning earnings streak has not gone unnoticed. AMD made the red-hot semiconductor ETF (, ) look like a boring government bond during the 2016 upswing as you can see when looking at the ratio spread between AMD and the SOXX ETF below. Unfortunately, this outperformance has turned into underperformance in the first quarter of 2017 when doubts arose as to whether AMD would be able to continue its performance in 2017 and 2018., One of my favorite quotes comes from a 1989 press conference when Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said:, We must win, we will win, win is the name of the game., In AMD's case, it is key that 2018 is going to deliver a good performance. Simply to show that it stands a chance against NVIDIA (, ) and to continue the positive EPS and sales trend that started in the first quarter of 2016., Leo Sun has examined, that will determine whether AMD is going to be successful in 2018., 1. New Ryzen CPUs, AMD scored a brief victory earlier this year with its new Ryzen CPUs, which offered comparable performance as Intel's (NASDAQ:, ) current-generation Kaby Lake CPUs at lower prices. AMD also launched the high-end Threadripper (two eight-core Ryzen CPUs linked by its Infinity Fabric), and challenged Intel's near-monopoly in data centers with its Epyc chips., 2. New Vega GPUs, Volta-based GPUs are currently only available for data center customers, but NVIDIA plans to launch the consumer versions next year. AMD plans to counter Volta with its next-generation 12nm Vega GPUs next year, but it could face a tough uphill battle., 3. An Intel deal, In a strange twist, AMD recently partnered with Intel to integrate its Radeon graphics into Intel's upcoming chipset for laptops. This partnership is risky, since it could curb demand for AMD's own Raven Ridge APUs., 4. Strong EESC performance, AMD's EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) business became a pillar of growth over the past few years as it supplied semi-custom SoCs to leading gaming consoles like the Xbox One and PS4. But with both consoles now four years old, the EESC business needs fresh catalysts., Every positive signal seems to have a negative side. The deal with Intel could increase Radeon graphics' success while it might provide Intel with the opportunity to take further market share from AMD in the long term. The same goes for its new products in the CPU and GPU space. New products are immediately answered with new product releases from NVIDIA and Intel which makes it even harder to gain market share after what some might call years of severe underperformance., Even though it seems that the new Ryzen 5 and 7 are doing very well so far with up to 40-50% market share as of the third quarter of 2017. Furthermore, the company mentions the positive trend in the computer industry which confirms the macro/industry analysis I showed you at the start of this article., Market Realist displayed the performance of AMD's Ryzen quite well as you can see below. The Ryzen 7 is in the top 3 CPU performers at a price that is (unlike many other AMD products) not in the low-cost category., However, once again we are facing the problem that AMD is not able to beat Intel's i7 and NVIDIA's gaming PC product portfolio which emphasizes the need to partner with Intel as I just showed you. The stakes are high and results have to confirm the validity of this deal in 2018., The last time AMD's price target has been increased has been in July when the average price target went from $12.82 to $13.40 where it has been since then. NVIDIA on the other hand saw its price target almost double during the same period. And I am not making a case that these price targets are a guideline - which they are not. It just shows that traders are very cautious when it comes to the performance of AMD., I see AMD as an interesting play going into 2018. Expectations are low while the company is far from giving up on new products. It seems that they are just getting started even though every new product is immediately facing a tough(er) competitor., AMD is very likely going to get more growth in the PC and cloud market while the total computer market upswing will lift cyclical growth on top of the much needed secular trend of innovation within AMD., I am probably going to start a small speculative position over the next few days to add to if the trade works out. I also advise to keep positions small in case you are going long.

Take a look for yourself at the total returns since 10/23/2017:, From a valuation perspective, MU is on a semiconductor-league of its own (compares to AMD and NVDA) over the past year:, It's no wonder then that the most attractive valuation and, therefore, the most solid bet here remains MU., When I wrote that AMD "", "" I wouldn't imagine in my wildest projection that the only incorrect word in this projection would be the year.

Nonetheless, taking profits is part of trading and there's no need to be sorry for making money, even if more money could have been made., My current reply: True. I'm not an expert in AI.

The exceptions aren't changing the importance and accuracy of the overall process!, While threads are not a valid/reliable indicator to a bullish or bearish stance, I can tell you that throughout my 21+ months of regular-extensive writing for SA, I've discovered that there's quite a good (inverse) correlation between the comment being one-sided to the valuation of a stock;, Although this is not an empiric observation, I find that such, So was the case when I pointed at many, (, ) as being an overvalued segment..., So was the case when I pointed at, (, ) specifically as being an overvalued eREIT..., And so is the case now with NVDA..., The share price dropped circa 20% (from peak to trough), in less than four weeks, for various reasons., First and foremost, the technology sector (as a whole) as well as its leading FAAMNG gang members (specifically) retreated over the past two weeks (since 11/28/2017):, If even Microsoft (, ), Google (, ,, ), Facebook (, ), Apple (, ), Amazon (, ) and Netflix (, ) are ""taking a nap"" - it should be no wonder that NVDA is joining the FAAMNG gang in an even sharper move down., Even if we look at the performances of the relevant names since 11/10/2017, NVDA doesn't look any better.

"A few weeks ago, I detailed how, when it came to chip company Advanced Micro Devices (, ). Despite a decent Q3 earnings report, short interest had surged for the stock to a new multi-year high. Late Monday, the latest data for this key figure came in, and I continue to be surprised by the number of people betting against this name., NASDAQ released its data for the end of November, and for the second half of the month, the number of shares short for AMD increased by about 3.9 million. As you can see in the chart below, nearly 180 million shares are now short, the highest I've seen in the roughly 2.5 years I've tracked this. While there are certainly a lot more shares outstanding than there were a few years ago, we have now seen a 150% increase in short interest from the low point seen just 15 months ago., (, If AMD shares were surging to new highs, I wouldn't be surprised by a bunch of new short sellers running in, but that's not the case. Shares finished last month under $11 per share, more than 30% off their 52-week high. There hasn't been any major news that would cause me to change my opinion on the name, and actually things might be stronger than expected thanks to sales of chips used for Bitcoin mining as the cryptocurrency frenzy continues., To show you how the situation has improved quite dramatically, I put together the following chart showing how much analyst estimates have surged. In the Spring of 2016, the company was only expected to do $3.85 billion in revenues for that year, along with a sizable non-GAAP loss. As the highlighted box shows, actual results were much better than that., (Source:, We have continued to see projections for this year and next increase over time. In the past 20 months, this year's top line estimate has jumped by nearly $1.2 billion, nearly 30 percent, while the street has gone from expecting a decent sized non-GAAP loss to now expecting a profit. While I don't have as much data for 2018, there is nice improvement in those estimates as well. If the trend continues, it seems highly likely that AMD will have more than $6 billion in revenues, and there is definitely potential for a GAAP profit as well. With all of the consolidation in the chip industry that we are seeing, AMD might even be a decent acquisition target considering its current valuation under $10 billion., At this point, I just don't understand why short interest continues to rise. As you can see in the chart below, AMD shares have tanked recently, and at under $10 are less than 60 cents from their 52-week low. If the business wasn't doing well, I would expect short sellers to be increasing, but analyst estimates are rising by the month. Should this pattern continue into year's end, any good news next year could easily make this stock ripe for a short squeeze. If this Bitcoin craze continues, I may end up choosing AMD as one of my highest recommended stocks for 2018., (, , , I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

"""It's déjà vu all over again."", Yogi Berra said that once and now I am saying it about my old favorite AMD (, )., In May of this year, I sold my AMD stock for $11.12 that I had purchased in 2015 for $2.98. In between those dates I wrote 33 articles on AMD (as Anchorite) praising new management and their laser-like focus on designing products that could compete. My first article was titled “, ”, See all 33 AMD articles, However, after what I considered to be a lackluster sales forecast for 2017 I decided my $25 price target was unreasonable until further improvement in revenue and margin expansion could be seen. Well, on November 29, AMD’s CEO Lisa Su did just that. Therefore, my change of heart on AMD’s future prospects., Three years ago when CEO Lisa Su took over there were legitimate questions about AMD’s future. Losses were stacking up year after year and FCF (free cash flow) was negative from at least 2012 to 2015. In reality, AMD did not have any competitive products except at the very low end. Su narrowed the company’s focus on just a few competitive high-end products that could be sold readily to the current customer base. She also sold some non-essential company divisions and managed to raise enough cash to see AMD through its R&D oriented turnaround. The result was 2017’s impressive product roll-outs in desktop (Ryzen), server (EPYC) and graphics (Polaris and Vega). There is little doubt now that AMD will have profits going forward as far as the eye can see., As AMD’s server chip Opteron went from 25% market share to 0% market share, analysts legitimately questioned AMD’s R&D capabilities. And although AMD sold lots of CPU chips they were mostly under $100 and some were under $50. In graphics, they tended to be hot and heavy and that's not meant as a compliment. It looked like AMD was just another tech stock headed for oblivion. But now Ryzen, Epyc, Polaris and Vega have put those doubts to rest. And new products using Zen 2 and 3 already are in production according to several sources. This gives customers confidence that AMD’s products will continue to be competitive for the foreseeable future., For the last several years AMD’s gross margins were in the high 20s or low 30s percentage. This is understandable when you are selling desktop CPUs, with a cooling fan, for $31, )., However, in her latest appearance CEO Su said this about future margins:, “But our model is generally conservative on pricing and then has that OpEx factor of let’s call it $0.20 on the $1 of revenue growth and that gets us to our 40% to 44% margin target on the growth side and then the mid-teens operating target by 2020.”, And revenue:, “We are very focused on not just ramping today’s revenue, but really building the foundation for multiple years of double-digit revenue growth.”, I once calculated, based upon operating margins, that Intel’s (, ) GM on the DCG (Data Center Group) was more than 70%. Now AMD does not have margins as high as Intel but certainly AMD’s “Data Center Group,” as it were, will have GM at least in the high 50’s. And going from zero, none, nada market share to 25% is going to have huge positive effects on margins and profits., Analyst John Pitzer’s question:, “What kind of milestones should we be thinking about as far as share gains with EPYC over the coming one to three years?”, Here is what CEO Su said:, “By the end of 2018, we should be at mid-single-digit percentage and that’s very similar to the original Opteron ramps. So, it takes about, let’s call it, four to five quarters to hit that first milestone of significant market share. Then the next milestone is 10% and that takes another four quarters. So think about it that way. And then look, we believe that our Zen 2 and Zen 3 products are actually even more competitive than the first generation Zens. And so with that, we think our long-term goals are to hit that 25% range of market share.”, A 25% market share would represent at least $5 billion in high-margin revenue. And these numbers come from one of the most conservative technology CEOs I have come across., The Super 7 are Amazon (, ), Microsoft (, ), Alibaba (, ), Facebook (, ), Google (, ) (NASDAQ:, ), Baidu (, ) and Tencent (, ). I can’t find any information on what percentage of server chips they buy. But with millions of chips in thousands of server farms, it must be a very high percentage. And CEO Su had this to say about them:, “We have every major super 7 that is working with us on EPYC. And so I think what we are seeing is that there is a clear demand for more choices in the datacenter market.”, And just this week AMD announced, to use EPYC in MSFT’s Azure cloud systems., In 2017 revenues should reach about $5 billion, up 18% from 2016. If we project forward at 18% through 2020 we end up with about $8.2 billion in sales. Personally, I think 2018 will be higher than 18%., Then we take Lisa Su’s projection of 42%-44% gross margin, increase SG&A by 10% per year and we end up with our projections. And remember Su said, “our model is generally conservative” so revenue and margins could end up higher than my projections. And the model does not include any IP revenue which is basically pure profit. “It’s not something that we model in our forward model.” Therefore, my projections are reasonable and in fact may be too conservative., If AMD progresses in a manner similar to the above spreadsheet then in 2019 a $25 price would only be 20x next years (2020) projected earnings. For comparison, per Nasdaq, Nvidia (, ) is selling at 63x projected next years (2018) earnings of $3.05. And although NVDA is leading in the graphics race, it does not have the duopoly x86 business nor the licensing deal with Intel. So in my estimation 20x is more than reasonable., The AMD of today is a completely different company from the one I recommended more than two years ago. There was a considerable question about AMD’s viability back then but now there's no question they will not only survive but thrive. Profits and cash flow are coming as the new products pick up steam in 2018 and beyond., Of course, there are caveats too. AMD is still a long way from matching the financial robustness of their two main competitors Intel and Nvidia. And my projections largely depend upon AMD's EPYC server chips obtaining a market share growth as outlined above. Further competition in the server chip market from Intel and perhaps even from Qualcomm and their new Centriq ARM server chip could affect future profits substantially., Currently, AMD is a little under $10 per share and IMO they will be much higher than that when 2020 rolls around. The downside risk is limited and AMD is generally uncorrelated to the market which is another plus., AMD is a strong buy and we have initiated a purchase of 500 shares at $9.98 for our Turnaround Stock Advisory brokerage account., Please note my subscribers received, , , I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

The company is widening its addressable market beyond desktop, laptops, and servers with its foray in mobile. But shareholders may take advantage of the market’s mispricing of AMD stock. Investors have just a month to add to AMD before revenue accelerates in 2018., There are four AMD reasons why is poised for a breakout, ending its more than month-long slump., AMD, on December 5 that it would work with Qualcomm (, ) to bring PC connectivity solutions to AMD’s Ryzen mobile processors. Most importantly from the partnership is Qualcomm’s LTE modem and AMD’s graphics and CPU processors coming together. Though, (, ) may lose some market share with the combined products coming from the pair, Intel already is committing to powering its next business computer desktops with AMD graphics., Intel’s eighth generation mobile processors will integrate with AMD GPUs. The previous generation drew 45W of power. This is due to higher core counts and higher clock speeds. In the next generation, the Intel CPU and AMD Radeon GPU will have a stacked, second-generation HBM2 (High Bandwidth Memory). Intel’s “Embedded Multi-Die Interconnect Bridge,” or EMIB, will connect the GPU with its memory. In effect, the package will need less space., Source: Intel, The partnership will have a negative impact for Nvidia, which was Intel’s supplier for graphics power. But NVDA stock hardly fell in the last three months:, In the last month, selling in NVDA stock accelerated:, Before AMD released EPYC, cloud suppliers could only buy Intel Xeon server chips. Now, cloud servers may use EPYC for powering the solution. EPYC’s advantage is not in the processing speed over Intel Xeon, but support for significantly more threads, cores, more memory and I/O bandwidth, offered by Intel’s Xeon. The solution has so much power that, (, ) will power Azure virtual machines with EPYC. The L-series v.2 virtual machine will use EPYC 7551 processors: 32 cores and 64 thread processors. Customers may choose from four virtual machine configurations, all of which vary by core-count, memory, and high-speed storage on Solid State Drives. Since Microsoft priced version 1 VMs at a starting price of under $230/month, expect similar pricing for version 2., AMD committed a regrettable error with its release of two versions of the Radeon RX 560. The company launched a downgraded version that was significantly weaker but unnecessarily confusing for consumers. Gamers quickly reacted negatively to the deception. This forced AMD to acknowledge that the launch of two variants of the Radeon RX 560 confused customers. The more powerful RX 560 has 16 compute units and 1024 stream processors. The lighter version, dubbed 14CU, has only 14 compute units and 896 stream processors., In a statement to Gamers Nexus, AMD wrote:, “It’s correct that 14 Compute Unit (896 stream processors) and 16 Compute Unit (1024 stream processor) versions of the Radeon RX 560 are available. We introduced the 14CU version this summer to provide AIBs and the market with more RX 500 series options. It’s come to our attention that on certain AIB and etail websites there’s no clear delineation between the two variants. We’re taking immediate steps to remedy this: we’re working with all AIB and channel partners to make sure the product descriptions and names clarify the CU count, so that gamers and consumers know exactly what they’re buying. We apologize for the confusion this may have caused.”, AMD did put a version the slimmer GPU as an RX 560D but retailers did not differentiate between the two GPUs.

"Shareholders of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:, ) have had a rocky past few weeks. Market capitalization of the company has shrunk by almost one-third since late-October, ever since the chipmaker reported its Q3 results. While some commenters feel the recent downtrend in its shares was justified, I find the recent near-30% crash pretty much unwarranted, unreasonable and uncalled for. The chipmaker is gearing up for a full-fledged launch of Ryzen Mobile going forth and I believe the chipmaker has a substantial growth potential in store for its shareholders. Let's take a closer look., AMD’s latest line of desktop-grade Ryzen SKUs made headlines this year when their multi-core performance turned out to be superior than Intel’s (NASDAQ:, ) then-flagship 7, generation SKUs. The impact of AMD’s new chips was such that Intel had to respond by increasing the core counts in its 8, generation mobile and desktop chips. The motive behind this move was to prevent AMD from gaining any further ground in notebook and desktop segments., This doesn’t necessarily put AMD’s Ryzen Mobile in a precarious position. Actually, it seems like AMD’s just-released flagship chips, 2500u and 2700u, have a rather appealing value proposition. Benchmarks available to us suggest that Intel may still be leading the single-threaded performance, but AMD has an upper hand in multi-threaded mobile performance. Also, AMD’s integrated graphics performance in Ryzen Mobile, specifically talking about its latest 2700u here, is far better than anything that Intel’s U-series chips can offer - illustrated in the chart below., (, ), AMD has, historically, had better graphics IP than Intel, so it was largely expected that AMD’s APUs would trump Intel’s similarly spec’d mobile chips in terms of graphics performance at least. This statement is corroborated by the fact that, to bolster the iGPUs of its H-series chips, instead of relying on beefier versions of its own Intel HD graphics. I suspect that Ryzen Mobile’s prowess in multi-threaded applications and substantially better graphics performance would encourage several OEMs to equip their notebooks with AMD’s latest APUs., Desktop variants of Ryzen SKUs competed on better multi-core performance; the Ryzen Mobile line-up builds on that, and in addition, also offers a better iGPU compared to similarly spec’d Intel chips. So, the value proposition for Ryzen Mobile is more apparent now, than it was with Ryzen desktop. This is why I expect Ryzen Mobile to nab a significant market share from currently existing dedicated and integrated GPU offerings from Intel and Nvidia (NASDAQ:, )., But don’t take my word for it. Here’s what some of the popular technology sites had to say about Ryzen Mobile:, , So, what’s the business case for Ryzen Mobile?, I’d like to start by saying that AMD’s financial gains over the past year have been largely due to the success of Ryzen desktop and Pascal/Vega GPU parts. Its sales channel and inventories are currently filled with Bristol Ridge APUs (predecessor to Raven Ridge/Ryzen Mobile) that are based on a relatively inferior manufacturing process and a dated chip architecture. Its Zen architecture, which brought the chipmaker a fair degree of success in the desktop segment, is only starting to make an entry into the notebook segment., Three Ryzen Mobile, have been confirmed so far – HP Envy X360, Lenovo Ideapad 720S and Acer Swift 3 – but I believe more OEMs will follow suit over the coming months, broadly because:, In my opinion, the race for mobile chip domination is only starting for AMD. If its latest notebook chips perform consistently under varying workloads, I believe the chipmaker would witness a strong OEM pick-up in Q1 2018. I’d like to point to readers that unlike the desktop segment, AMD won’t have to target its DIY and OEM customers separately with Ryzen Mobile. This should, in theory, streamline its production targeting, supply allocation, marketing efforts and feedback loops compared to its desktop-driven operations. So, this is an added bonus compared to its desktop operations., Also, I believe the notebook segment would be particularly important for AMD from a financial standpoint. Fact of the matter is that Ryzen Mobile’s addressable market is much bigger than their desktop-grade parts. The chart attached below should put things in perspective. Notebook sales have been significantly higher than desktops over the past several years now. For instance, notebook sales exceeded desktop sales by over 51% during 2016. Industry-wide forecasts suggest that this trend of notebooks outselling desktops would further tilt in favor of notebooks over the coming years., Besides that, notebook microprocessors tend to have higher listing prices than their desktop counterparts. Just to cite one example amongst many, Intel’s flagship desktop-grade, sports a price tag of $350 while its notebook-grade flagship, is listed at $415 even though the latter is under-powered. Based on the assumption that AMD continues with this pricing model, and prices its mobile chips higher than desktop parts, I’m forecasting that Ryzen Mobile will increase AMD’s average selling prices by another 15-20% from the current levels., AMD APUs have generally had minimal presence in this much-larger notebook market over the past 2 years due to their relatively obsolete chip architectures and dated manufacturing processes, compared to Intel’s. But the market dynamic could change going forward. AMD has a chance to reinvigorate its APU sales with the Zen-based Ryzen Mobile, the same architecture that revived its desktop sales as well. Only this time around, AMD’s Zen architecture stands to target a larger market of notebooks of varying price points, with a better iGPU as a bonus., We see Ryzen continuing to ramp. We will ship volume of Ryzen mobile in Q4 and then more in the first half of the year. We will see a ramp of EPYC and we will also see an OEM ramp of Vega. -- Dr. Lisa Su, Q3FY17, Considering the timeline of Ryzen Mobile volume ramp, it's a given that the sales of AMD's latest APUs will reflect on AMD's financials starting with Q1 of 2018. It should, in my opinion, further:, 1) drive its computing and graphics revenue higher,, 2) increase the revenue contribution of computing and graphics segment as a percentage of the chipmaker's overall revenue, and, 3) drive its overall revenue higher., After applying custom growth forecasts to both of AMD's reporting segments for each of the upcoming FY18 quarters, normalising exceptionally high growth rates in the past, and factoring in the incremental contribution from Ryzen Mobile, my forecasting model churns out $6.05 billion in FY18 revenue. This equates to a 15.2% jump in sales from its FY17 sales, . I believe it's a modest FY18 growth rate, and not unreasonably high, considering the fact that the chipmaker is in the midst of an ongoing turnaround and has a slew of exciting product releases scheduled for 2018., To put it simply, I’m bullish on AMD’s Ryzen Mobile line-up. But as a part of our due diligence, readers should also be aware of the few caveats that could potentially hurt the chipmaker’s notebook-related prospects., For starters, we don’t know anything about the pricing of Ryzen Mobile SKUs. This is one of the key factors that could impact their adoption rate amongst OEMs. Price them too high, and the chips won’t sell. Price them too low, and they fail to become the growth catalyst that we’re hoping them to be. So, pricing needs to be just right., Secondly, supply could be an issue. As I’ve mentioned previously in the article, OEMs won’t prefer launching their notebooks based on unreliable and unpredictable supply patterns of AMD’s latest APUs. I think these large-scale clients would rather ditch AMD’s latest generation of mobile SKUs altogether if they’re not sure about stable supplies. So, AMD needs to ensure it ramps up Ryzen Mobile output fast enough to not lose any potential business from OEMs., We also don’t have any concrete numbers on the ""actual"" power consumption of 2700u and 2500u chips. It’s being suspected that these chips would have a practical use only if their actual power draw is less than that of an Intel U-series chip (15W – 8250u?) coupled with a low-end Nvidia dedicated GPU (25W - MX150?). Otherwise it would make sense for OEMs to simply use a low-end GPU with an Intel chip in a bid to maximise battery life., I believe AMD has been beaten down a bit too much. The chart attached below indicates that the chipmaker is currently undervalued by a significant margin., The comparison is based on forward-looking metrics rather than relying on trailing data - it's a more meaningful approach to value companies that are in the process of turning around, in my opinion., This is because AMD was stuck with obsolete or dated products in the past, which made it difficult for the company to move product. If we still continue valuing the chipmaker based on those past financials, from a period where it lacked competitive products, I think we're bound to arrive at skewed results., Hence, my inclination towards forward valuation metrics., After years of waiting, AMD finally has competitive products for both notebook and desktop segments. Importantly, the addressable market of its latest Ryzen Mobile line-up is larger than what its desktop line-up is targeting. Plus, its new APUs are positioned to further boost its average selling prices. After all that, its stock price collapses by 30%? I don’t think it adds up; I rather see the weakness in AMD shares as a buying opportunity. Ryzen Mobile appears to be a promising positive catalyst for the chipmaker that, in my opinion, could contribute meaningfully to drive the company's overall growth ahead., , , I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

"In December of last year, AMD (, ) stock was trading at a similar price as it is today ($10). By February 2017 the stock had risen over 50% to $15, and now it has tumbled back down to $10. is this a dip or a fall?, Although there are some definite risks for the stock, AMD is in a much better position than one year ago. This year earnings are not only higher than last years, but also Non-GAAP profitable. The company has increased its partners and has a solid product lineup that will keep growing next year. Indeed, last year the stock was overvalued, but now the market seems to be overcorrecting., I usually use the Peter Lynch's method for growth valuation. This method uses the ratio between the expected earnings growth and the P/E of the stock to determine its fair value. A stock that has a 1:1 ratio is fairly priced. The higher the number, the more underpriced the stock is. The problem with this particular case is that AMD earnings growth expectations have an extensive range., With the current price of $10, the stock has a Non-GAAP P/E of about 140, so the stock would have to grow its earnings by 140% to be fairly priced. The chart above shows that the expected earnings growth for next year is anywhere from 100% to 600%. ($0.14 to $0.49 per share vs current $0.07)., The bottom of the range puts the fair price of the stock around $7, and the opposite side sets the fair price around $42. Both cases seem equally unlikely as, for them to be true, the earnings would have to be at the very bottom, or at the very top of the estimates range for the next four quarters in a row., This chart may not give a direct answer for the fair price of the stock, but it does paint a clear picture of the risk-reward of the stock. On the downside, for the stock to be fairly priced, it would have to keep falling to $7, while on the optimistic side the stock it is very undervalued., Although both extremes seem farfetched, the range that puts the stock as undervalued is much higher than the range that has it overvalued. The most likely growth and consequential fair price are probably somewhere in the middle of that range., AMD's quarter to quarter change seems erratic, and difficult to predict or model., However, when comparing last year quarters to this year's, a much clearer pattern is revealed. The improvement is not only easy to model, but it makes sense., AMD plays in a seasonal market, which explains why comparing quarter to quarter is less reliable than comparing quarters of different years. The delta behavior is within a relatively small range and slowly decreasing, which also makes sense, since it is unreasonable to expect that AMD will keep growing at this pace forever., A model of the delta behavior forecasts the quarterly earnings for next year higher than this year by a range of $0.06 to $0.04, which would be lovely for the stock but, in my opinion, too optimistic. Instead, let's cut the delta in half, meaning that next year AMD will improve half as much as it did this year. The resulting Non-GAAP EPS for 2018 would be $0.27, more than double the expected 2017 EPS., Using the model above, by Q3 of 2018, the EPS would be around $0.24, 240% higher than they are now, putting the fair price of the stock between $17- $20., There are four great opportunities for AMD in the next year:, Gaming and Freesync: Not only does AMD powers the XBOX (, ) and the Playstation (, ), it is also gaining ground in the computer gaming area. Its product line-up is impressive, and the Freesync technology is a worthy contender against Nvidia (, ) G-Sync. In my opinion, AMD implementation strategy for Freesync is much better than Nvidia´s. AMD uses the open adaptive Sync standard that most manufacturers already use, while Nvidia sells its own adaptor to monitor manufacturers. Arguably it would be easier for monitor manufacturers to adapt to AMD standard and the monitor prices would be lower., The Chromebook Business: As I have discussed in a, and, . The Chromebook business is rapidly growing, and most Chromebooks are powered by Intel. It appears that AMD is finally in the works of powering its, . In the past, AMD has done very well competing against Intel in low price products (as it did with the Ryzen 3). It will be interesting to see if AMD can grab a share of the Chromebook market and what pricing strategy it will take., Cryptocurrency mining: Although management has made clear that it will not go after the cryptocurrency mining business directly, AMD is certainly benefitting from Bitcoin (, ) and other cryptocurrency mining. It is safe to say that blockchain technology will keep expanding, at least for the next few years, which will continue increasing the overall demand for graphics cards and its price, benefitting mostly AMD and NVIDIA that dominate the graphics card market., While the fair price of the stock could arguably be as low as $7, it is more likely that the stock is undervalued, and with great potential upside., Considering the growth potential AMD has, it would surprise me that the price will go much lower than it is today, As Warren Buffett said, ""Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy only when others are fearful."", , , I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
