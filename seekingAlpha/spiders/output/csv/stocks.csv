They are under investigation for their role in several wildfires throughout California, most notably the Camp, which resulted in 86 deaths and was the costliest natural disaster of, . For all of the fires, PG&E could face liabilities that total a minimum of $30, ., PG&E currently has a market cap of less than $10 billion and an enterprise value of $28, , at time of writing.

Groundwater, , criminal negligence for failing to trim, , exploding, with activity that registered on the earthquake scale, and potentially causing twelve, are some of the most notable ones., Source:, Among all the news, the S&P Global Ratings downgraded PG&E's credit to B from BBB-, which is officially junk, .

Moody's and Fitch are also in the process of reviewing the company, and if they decide to cut the bonds to high yield, that would be further increase pressure on PG&E., If the other two rating agencies decide to downgrade PG&E, an $800 million cash collateral call would rip through the, . The company has already suspended its dividend and drew out all lines of credit. They are running out of liquidity options, increasing the potential to continue on with bankruptcy plans, if another downgrade occurs., The utility filed for bankruptcy back in 2001 and reemerged in 2004 under a new reorganization, . But the circumstances are different now. Now, both the utility and the holding company are under fire, from acts ranging from sheer negligence, to breaking safety rules, and to falsifying, Finally, PG&E's senior vice president of electric operations is retiring on January 28th after a five year tenure with the company, which the market did not respond well to. Patrick Hogan belongs to the actual PG&E arm of the company, rather than the corporation. It's normal for companies to shake up management when in the midst of something as potentially catastrophic as a bankruptcy. And PG&E has walked this line before., The only issue is, PG&E isn't going down alone, if they go down at all. 31 institutions and 20 hedge funds have the company in their top ten, , with 609 institutions holding the stock and 87 hedge funds. Hedge funds have increased their exposure by, ., As of September 30th 2018, BlackRock owns almost $2 billion in market value of the company, totaling 48 million, totaling almost 10% of the PG&E.

The probability of default has increased, but it still remains relatively low, especially compared to the beginning of the year., Source:, PG&E is the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 Utilities Group. The S&P 500 Utilities Index has massively outperformed PG&E even over the past five years, posting a ~38% return versus PG&E's ~53% decline. Optimistically, this means that there is a lot of room to the upside for the PG&E. On the flip side, the momentum appears to be to the downside, with several variables weighing on the direction that the company could go., Source:, PG&E is not like other publicly traded companies. It has complete market control over the electricity for 5.4 million homes, and gas for 4.3 million. They are responsible for almost half the state of California. They are an investor owned utility, so they carry a responsibility to shareholders as, ., Utilities are highly regulated. The market does not set its rates, the, does. PG&E was asking for a $1.1 billion revenue increase in early December, according to their General Rate, which doesn't include funding for claims against the wildfires., The future of California's climate change goals rests in the existence of PG&E. There are billions and billions of dollars in contracts that will collapse if PG&E goes under, which would ""send potentially a very negative signal in terms of future development in California"" according to Jan Smutny-Jones, chief executive of Independent Energy, ., Source:, Regulators are trying to decide whether they should let the company issue bonds to pay for its liabilities, or break it up entirely. Even if PG&E gets bailed out by California, there is so much risk surrounding the stock with credit downgrades and the potential for more disasters in the future., Xerox (, ) was downgraded to junk back in December, They cut, and the stock fell 13%. But Xerox doesn't provide electricity to millions of homes, nor does it provide heating in the middle of winter. Utility stocks are considered a defensive strategy within a portfolio, primarily because of the necessity of the product they provide. They have a monopoly on products and services, and those goods are relatively inelastic., There is a lot of pressure on PG&E currently. They completely eliminated their, . Bankruptcy talks are never a positive sign. There is a general appearance that they don't seem to learn from their previous mistakes. PG&E is owned primarily by institutions, with the general public holding approximately 14% of the, ., But they are an integral component of people's lives. The utility, not the corporation, filed for bankruptcy before, back in 2001 during the energy crisis. Back then, executives said: ""The political regulatory process has been able to negotiate but not close the deal. A federal bankruptcy court is a better way to get a deal, ."" Governor Gray Davis called the filing a ""slap in the face to, ."", Shareholders who held on to PG&E throughout that Chapter 11 process saw their investment, . Rate payers paid off $7.2 billion of PG&E's, . But now, in 2019, things are different, as PG&E could be potentially responsible for the loss of lives and massive natural disasters. A utility bankruptcy would weigh on California's entire electricity business., Gavin Newsom took the office as the new California governor on Monday, and he said, ""My role for the state of California is to protect your interests and not PG&E's, interest but sometimes those interests align and that's where it gets, ."" PG&E spent $8.4 million in the first three quarters of the 2018 on lobbying, which is $7 million more than it spent throughout all of, ., The direction of PG&E is up in the air. They could file for bankruptcy, just as they did back in 2001, without much warning. Or they could take a bailout package from the state, potentially sweetened by lobbying money. Or their bond ratings could get slashed even more. Criminal charges could be brought against them. They could be converted into a publicly owned utility., But right now, PG&E's goal is to optimize shareholder return on investment. Institutional investors seem to recognize that, as hedge funds increase their stake in the company. Cash flows are positive. The company trades at an elevated PE ratio, but their EV / EBITDA value is far below industry peers., Source:, The company has room to the upside. But, they also have a series of extreme allegations against them. This seems to be an investment that could really pay off, or one that could collapse. Giving the company more time to sort itself out might be the best play here. However, if you think that the stock has bottomed out and the company will get bailed out, it would probably be a good buy., , ",,PG&amp;E Corporation (PCG),https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/1/9/48745605-15470632785437343.png
"Despite a 4% loss utilities were December's best performing sector., PCG remained in the headlines and once again was the worst performing stock in the XLU., The uncertainty at PCG make the bonds look like a superior bet than the stock right now., Milder December weather led to a decline in natural gas prices, which led to a decline in wholesale power prices.",December Utility Review - PG&E Is The Big Story Again,,"December was a tough month for all stock investors, including those in the utility space. The Utility Select Sector SPDR ETF (, ) was down almost 4%, but that loss still had the sector as the best performer for the month. The XLU finished 2018 as the number two sector of the year behind Health Care., Source: FactSet and Garnet Research, A couple of factors helped to reduce the XLU’s decline during the month. The utility group’s bond substitute status benefited from a 33bp drop in the ten-year Treasury yield. Investors also seemed to be getting defensive as the stock market was performing badly, with the assets under management (AUM) of the XLU increasing by over $500M. This was the highest AUM level for the XLU in 2018, and the highest level for that fund in over two years., Source: FactSet and Garnet Research, Only four XLU components were up in December, with NRG Energy's (, ) 3% gain leading the way. It has been about 18 months since NRG announced their portfolio optimization plan (see more, ), and investors seem to be happy with the progress as they continue to bid up the stock price., Source: FactSet and Garnet Research, Edison International (, ) was the number two performing utility in December, and it benefited from a 3¢/share dividend increase. EIX has been suffering from wildfire issues for a long time now, though they haven’t been suffering as much as Pacific Gas & Electric (, ), and this dividend increase seems to be a good signal related to those challenges. PCG suspended its dividend over a year ago because of concerns about the wildfires, but EIX’s dividend increase should mean the company has enough confidence in their wildfire exposure that their dividend is safe. Additionally, on December 6, EIX publicly released a letter they sent to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) relating to the Woolsey Fire (see press release, ). EIX stated that no energized lines were on the ground near where the fire started. They are still investigating other ways their equipment could have contributed to the start of the fire, but this was at least some positive news on the issue., The third best performing component was SCANA (, ), up 2.4%. SCANA has been plagued by over a year of drama related to halting construction of their new nuclear power plant after investing billions of dollars. The public was not happy about having to pay for a plant that doesn’t work, which created quite a political firestorm. Dominion came in with an offer to rescue SCG from some of these costs, and approval for the merger was finally granted in December, resulting in an up move at SCG for the month., On the downside, PCG once again was the XLU leader with an almost 10% drop. The overhang of the wildfires from the last two years continued to plague the stock, but December brought more bad news. On the 14, the CPUC announced an investigation into PCG’s gas business to see if they have been falsifying records and violating safety standards. (See article, .) A week later the CPUC discussed its investigation of PCG’s culture, and whether the company should bring in new leadership, if it should divide itself into smaller companies, or if it should become a publicly owned utility. These negative stories continued to pound on the stock and led to its terrible performance., Source: FactSet and Garnet Research, As discussed in last month’s utility review (see, ) all of these negative headlines impacted PCG’s bonds once again. Of the most actively traded utility bonds in December, seventeen of them were issued by PCG., PCG’s bond prices trended slightly downward during December, and then this week S&P downgraded PCG’s debt to junk level which sent the bonds back to the November lows. Exhibit 6 shows how a sample of those bonds has performed over the last two years., Source: FactSet and Garnet Research, Moody’s downgraded PCG’s credit ratings back in September and November, but they still kept the company at investment grade. (See, and, .) They still have PCG on review for a downgrade, so it is possible investment grade status won’t last. In the near term, a Moody’s downgrade shouldn’t have much of an impact on operations. The company is still conserving cash by not paying a dividend, and Moody’s estimated PG&E held about $3.5B in cash last November. Exhibit 7 shows PCG's bond maturity schedule, and there really aren't any huge refinancings in the next few years. Wall Street analysts currently estimate over $4.2B of cash from operations in 2019, so lots of money is still coming in the door to keep the lights on. The biggest near-term risk for the company is that a Moody's downgrade would trigger, from some contracted counterparties. A recent regulatory filing estimated this risk at about $800 million, still well below the company's current cash balance., Source: FactSet and Garnet Research, A Moody’s downgrade to junk would definitely have substantial near term implications to PCG investors. There is about $18B of Pacific Gas and Electric debt out there right now. The, , so PG&E would increase the size by about 1.5%. Not an impossible amount to absorb, but it would likely put some downward pressure on junk bond prices. The real disruption would likely take place for any current bondholders who are only allowed to own investment grade credits and would be forced to sell with a PCG downgrade. This could lead to a big drop in PCG bond prices. After forced sales are over, there would probably be some bounce back in the PCG bond prices, but it would likely be lower than today’s levels., Exhibit 8 shows the price and yield of PCG’s twenty-eight senior unsecured bonds., Source: FactSet and Garnet Research, In theory, all $14.5B of these bonds would be treated equally in a bankruptcy so you could spend approximately $90 on a 2020 maturity or about $75 on a 2046 maturity and have an equal claim. If bankruptcy were the only factor at play you would expect all the bonds to be similarly priced, but the higher yield of the near term maturities is likely bringing up their prices., In the future, there will be some electric utility serving northern California, so these wildfire issues have to be resolved. The president of the CPUC has also, for the health of state utilities, so there is reason to believe PG&E can survive. The big question is how investors come out at the end of this process. Before the wildfire issue PCG was almost a $70 stock, and some of that value is going to be lost no matter how these issues get resolved, but scenarios where the stock gets back to over $40 are very easy to imagine. Additionally, the wildfires have shown that more spending for system improvement is needed, so there could be reason to hope for faster growth at the company, which would counter the drain from wildfire costs. However, a counter to this counter could be that the wildfire solution entails the need for more regular share issuances, leading to overhang from dilution that could hold down the share price. Then there is also the extreme scenario where bankruptcy is declared and shareholders get wiped out. Of course, PCG declared bankruptcy after the California Electricity crises in the beginning of this century, and stockholders weren’t wiped out then. So, you can see that there is a very wide range of possible outcomes for PCG’s stock., For the bonds, the range of potential outcomes is narrower. If bankruptcy was declared the bonds could potentially take a haircut but that would mean wiping out the approximately $10B of current equity value, the, , and the $3B+ of cash the company has on hand. Additionally, bankruptcy means that the solutions California devises to keep a utility running in northern California are not enough to meet PCG’s normal obligations. This is not impossible, but it seems unlikely. So in a few years after these issues are resolved the bonds would likely start trading much closer to par. That means, if you take PCG’s March 2046 bond for example, that you could get a 30%+ return after a few years if the bond returned to par, on top of the 4.25% coupon payments. You can see back in Exhibit 6 that this bond traded near $110 less than two years ago. This really is an equity-level-type of return at dramatically less long-term risk than you can get investing in PCG shares right now. So if you want to invest in Pacific Gas & Electric today, the bonds look much superior to the stock. There is a near term risk that a Moody's downgrade would knock down the price of the bonds, but that should only be a short term issue, and it would be a particularly good buying opportunity as certain investors are forced to liquidate their positions., Power markets were quite disappointing in December, with prices lower across the board compared to November, and most markets showing significantly lower prices than December of last year. The weather didn’t cooperate, with heating degree days for December below normal and below 2017 levels., Electricity consumption in December was significantly below 2017 levels, which makes sense because of the milder weather., A closer look at Boston shows why November 2018 and December 2017 electricity prices were higher than December 2018 prices. It really comes down to natural gas prices being lower this December than the other two months., Natural gas tends to be the marginal fuel that sets electricity prices, and gas prices took a big jump in the middle of November. You can see in the chart that when gas prices are high the electricity prices also tend to be high. The average daily gas price in Boston in November came in at $6.52/mmBTU, but in December the average daily price fell to $5.82/mmBTU. Also, there were seven days in November where the average gas price was over $10/mmBTU, while there was only one of these days in December., For the December year-over-year comparison you can see that the last 2/3 of December 2017 had elevated gas prices, including the record extremes at the end of the month. This led to an average daily gas price of $9.17/mmBTU in December 2017 vs. the $5.82/mmBTU level in 2018. These 2017 high gas prices along with high demand for electricity created a benchmark that was impossible to meet this year., The national natural gas markets moved similarly to the markets in the Boston area discussed above. The early cold weather we received in November moderated throughout December, and as a result prices declined significantly., The mild December weather meant less drawdown of natural gas in storage, giving the market more confidence that we will make it through the winter without exhausting our supplies. We entered December with gas in storage about 700BCF below last year’s level, and we left December with just a 450BCF deficit. While extended cold weather could still cause problems for our nation’s natural gas system, the odds of this happening were dramatically reduced with the shrinking deficit., Lastly, the near term end of the natural gas futures curve moved as dramatically as the spot price in December. But it is interesting to note that further out on the curve prices barely budged. The futures market seems to be saying that the US natural gas supply situation is pretty stable for the long run. The market also seems to be taking a somewhat bearish very on natural gas for the next few years, especially compared to the outlook a year ago., Source: FactSet and Garnet Research, , ",,PG&amp;E Corporation (PCG),https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/1/10/6605251-15471319200231059.png
"PG&E Corporation filed for bankruptcy several days ago., That is a big move for a company that delivers electricity to 40% of California., While this is water under the bridge for most investors who own the company, there are still some key lessons for dividend growth investors.",What Dividend Growth Investors Can Learn From PG&E Corporation,,"PG&E Corporation (, ) announced several days ago that it is going to file for bankruptcy. While the situation of the company wasn't superb over the past two year to say the least, this announcement caught investors by surprise, and in the days since the announcement the share price declined over 50%. The share price that reached $70 just a year and a half ago reached a low of $6.91., The 2017 and 2018 wildfires resulted in California caused some major financial problems for the company. The company faces at least $30 billion in potential liability costs and cannot afford to pay it. The dividend was suspended more than a year ago, but the potential liabilities are so high that the company isn't even close to be able to fund them. Therefore, in order to keep being able to provide electricity and natural gas to its clients it will file for protection under chapter 11., The purpose of the article is to take the case of PG&E, and try to learn from it. In an attempt to learn from past mistakes, and past events, we try to become better investors in the future. Personally, I never owned shares in PG&E, but I still find this lesson valuable for me, and I will try to take advantage of the events to improve my dividend growth strategy., PG&E Corporation engages in the sale and delivery of electricity and natural gas to residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural customers in northern and central California. The company operates various electricity generation facilities, such as nuclear, hydroelectric, fossil fuel-fired, and solar. PG&E Corporation was founded in 1905 and is based in San Francisco, California., (Source:, ), In a recent article I explained my selling strategy. I explained how having an exit strategy, which is clear, and simple to implement is crucial to preserve capital. My selling strategy is to sell when a company fails to achieve the goals, I set for it. As a dividend growth investor, I expect a company to pay me growing stream of dividends. I can deal with a dividend being frozen for a while, but a dividend cut will result in immediate sell., Some readers commented that the dividend cut usually comes after most of the damage was done, and therefore, it is not a good strategy to preserve capital. The graph below shows how the stock price that reached $70 in August 2017, dropped to the lower $40s when the dividend cut was announced. It may seem like a good argument against my selling strategy., However, I still believe that selling after a dividend cut is a better strategy. You usually cannot see a dividend cut in advance. Sometimes you think the dividend is safe, and sometimes it comes out of the blue. It is even more dangerous to stay invested in the company after a dividend cut. It may start to recover, but you must remember that a dividend cut means that the fundamentals are deteriorating. Therefore, the stock price will continue to drop., From my perspective, even if the stock price doesn't drop, the risk is immense. The graph above shows exactly the case. Selling it for $40 after the dividend cut could preserve some capital, and even before the declaration of bankruptcy, the share price lagged. The same capital could have achieved higher returns elsewhere., I sold my position in Kinder Morgan (, ) when the company announced a dividend cut. I kept following the company and waited for its deleveraging and turnaround process to finish. Only then, when the company was again showing growth, I decided to initiate a small position. I analyzed the company like any new company I analyze, and I have no emotional attachment to any investment., Diversification is a key in preserving capital. Holding your personal capital in a low number of companies exposes you to a risk of losing a significant portion of your wealth. In 2008, the entire financial sector suffered from deteriorating fundamentals, dividend cuts, and investors who were focused on this sector suffered much heavier loses compared to the broader market. Companies that were dividend aristocrats like Bank of America (, ) and Citigroup (, ) plunged 90%., While sometimes the entire industry is affected by a bevy of black swans, sometimes a single event can destroy a single company. This was the case with PG&E. Six months before the dividend was suspended, the company offered a generous 8% dividend raise, that came just six months after a 7% dividend raise. Nobody could see the wildfires coming and anticipate the damage they will do to the company., In this case there was nothing that could be done, and major forces destroyed the value for shareholders. I find it hard to believe that there was something the company could do in the past to avoid this outcome. $30 billion in liabilities was something that no other management team could deal with., Because I understand that sometimes there are forces beyond our control that may affect a company significantly, I make sure that I am diversified. I am diversified within sectors, and within industries. I also use the 3% rule where I try to make sure that no position is more than 3% of my portfolio or income. I also use a 5% rule for very diversified companies like Johnson & Johnson (, )., The dividend that seems safest it the one that just got raised. It is usually true, and it is one of the reasons that investors in PG&E were surprised when the dividend got suspended. In the year prior to the dividend cut, the payment was raised significantly twice. Dividend growth investors always track past dividend increases to understand how the management sees the company., The dividend raises in the past cannot indicate what will happen in the future. They only show the priority of the management. Therefore, as a dividend growth investor, I also invest in companies with relative short dividend growth streaks. I look at the streak and combine it with the intentions and priorities of the company., The longest streak in history means nothing when a big blow hits a company. It happened in the case of BP (, ), when the company had to deal with major expenses due to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and it happened in the case of PG&E., Take into account dividend streak when you want to understand the management priorities. However, never assume that a long dividend streak means that the dividend is safe. Even the largest corporations may fail. PG&E serves 40% of California, and still couldn't survive this complex situation., Everyone fails as an investor. You may achieve great returns, but you will fail with some of your stock picks. Even Warren Buffet, one of the best investors in history suffered from several failures in his long career as a value investor. He recently sold his shares in IBM (, ) when it failed to live up to his expectations. Your starting point as investors should take into account that you will get burned in the process., What separates good investors is the ability to learn from their mistakes. I embrace my mistakes. I analyze them, think of my decision-making process, and try to understand them. I am not ashamed of my mistakes, and I even share them here on Seeking Alpha, so other will be able to learn from my mistakes. I believe that analyzing them and writing about them help me to understand them better., In the case of PG&E, I learn from other people's mistakes. There are two key issues here. The first one is to understand that even if you are the best stock picker, you cannot control every aspect in the business, and sometimes unexpected events happen. Therefore, diversification is extremely important to lower the volatility of your portfolio and the risk attached to investing in stocks., The second lesson is to sell your stock when the fundamentals are deteriorating for the long term. So far, I couldn't find a better warning sign for deteriorating fundamentals than a dividend cut. A dividend cut means that the lower revenues or income are not a temporary issue in the short-term. It means that the company believes that in the medium and long-term the company will not be able to achieve similar income., It is okay to take chances, make mistakes and get messy. Gaining experience is the best way to learn. Just make sure that you learn from your mistakes, and this way you will improve your skills as an investor. I try to make new mistakes, and not repeat my older mistakes., (Source:, ), , ",,PG&amp;E Corporation (PCG),https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/1/16/20475971-1547646215045982.png
