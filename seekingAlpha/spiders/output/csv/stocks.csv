(TSLA)",,Tesla: Quick Look At The 2019 Convertible Settlement,"Over the last two months, there have been several data points that suggest Tesla (, ) may have turned the corner financially. The company enjoyed positive cash flow during Q3 2018, it used cash to redeem its 2019 Convertible Notes due November 2018, and it notified 2019 Convertible Note (""2019 Converts"") holders on Dec. 1, 2018, that the settlement on March 1, 2019, would be 50/50 cash/common stock. These three data points hint at the improving financial health and operational capabilities of TSLA after a near-death experience during the ramp up of Model 3 production., After a very rough first half 2018, which is, , TSLA's stock has enjoyed a rebound from its nadir in early October, driven by the release of Q3 2018 earnings. There are a, . Particularly impressive is TSLA's performance relative to the S&P 500, as depicted in the graphs below. The volatility of TSLA's price performance during 2018 is clearly on display in comparison with the S&P 500 as is the sizable bounce off yearly lows since Oct. 22 (when TSLA announced its impending earnings release date)., As depicted in the first graph, the S&P 500 is down about 10% from its recent highs during August. The S&P 500 50-day moving average recently crossed over the 200 DMA forming what's known as a death cross. The momentum in the general market has been to the downside. This makes TSLA's recent performance an interesting contrast., If you believe that other automakers are peers, then TSLA also had outperformed its peers since late October. The companies included in the graph are not intended to be exhaustive list, just enough to offer some perspective without deteriorating into an unintelligible plate of spaghetti., . TSLA also had approximately $7.6 billion of recourse debt at Q3 and, prior to Q3, had a mostly red ink record of cash flow from operations (""CFFO""). Cash is the life blood of any struggling corporation. More important than all of the negative aspects of Elon Musk's behavior and TSLA's checkered history of missed deadlines and production milestones over the last 12 months is cash on the balance sheet. Quarterly cash flow is one of two primary and interrelated metrics that drive the stock price, the other being the aforementioned rate of production. As production climbed during Q3 relative to prior quarters, cash flow improved., The $230 million in 2018 Converts (former SolarCity converts) that matured November 2018 had a conversion price of $560.60 per share, well above TSLA's market price at the time. Investors always were going to opt to be paid in cash. The $920 million of .25% 2019 Converts due March 1 have a conversion price of $359.87. TSLA's stock price has been bouncing between $360 and $370 recently as several Wall Street analysts, including Oppenheimer, Baird and Wedbush, have upgraded the stock to neutral/market perform or even outperform. Investors may therefore chose to convert if the 20 trading day VWAP beginning 22 trading days prior to conversion exceeds the conversion price of $359.87 on the 2019 Converts (the definitions are a bit more complicated in the Prospectus but this is the plain English explanation). By my count, that means the observation period begins Jan. 29 and ends Feb. 26., The tricky thing about that observation period is that it will encompass Tesla's announcements on Q4 production and the release of Q4 and full-year earnings in early February. During the Q3 2018 conference call Musk stated:, “The current operating plan is to pay off our debts and not to refinance them, but to pay them off and reduce the debt load and overall leverage of the company,”, Given that the maturities of the November 2018 Converts and the March 2019 Converts would total $1.15 billion, this was quite a statement about Musk's confidence of staying meaningfully cash flow positive during Q4 2018 and Q1 2019. Consensus estimates by analysts support that confidence:, The electric car maker is expected to generate $360 million in free cash flow in the fourth quarter and about $110 million in the first three months of 2019, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg., Q4 earnings therefore set up as a binodal event for TSLA relative to the March 2019 Convert: If production shows continued improvements and cash flow meets estimates, the average of the 20-day VWAP for TSLA'S stock could remain above the conversion price and the noteholders will choose to convert. This means that TSLA will pay off $460 million of the Converts in cash and the remainder in common stock. The amount of common stock paid out on conversion will increase based on the difference between the average of the 20-day VWAP observation and the initial conversion price in the Prospectus. The greater the difference, the more shares that will be issued to the note holders upon conversion. As part of the offering, TSLA entered hedging contracts with the underwriters and third parties to limit the amount of dilution incurred in the instance where the average of the 20-day VWAP exceeds the initial conversion price., . As depicted in the table, a $400 average 20-day VWAP during the observation period would result in the issuance of an incremental 300k shares, the impact of the impact of the hedges and capped calls (which would reduce the actual dilution)., If TSLA misses the production targets or cash flow is worse than expected, TSLA will likely need to muster $920 million to repay the March 2019 Converts since the stock price should drop below the initial conversion price of $359.87., . Be forewarned, the descriptions of the settlement mechanism can seem a bit opaque at times., After a near-death experience rolling out the Model 3, I do not believe that Musk would risk the financial health of TSLA by choosing to pay down debt rather than opting to refinance the maturing convertibles. Yes, he has risked the financial well being of the company in the past to limit dilution, but that's not what he was facing with the maturity of these two issuances of convertible debt., “For me, the fact that we were able to build at scale, amid all that craziness, that’s the real accomplishment,” one former engineering executive told me. “Just think about it: We designed a car that is so simple and elegant you can build it in a tent. You can build it when your CEO is melting down. You can build it when everyone is quitting or getting fired. That’s a real accomplishment. That’s amazing.”, Quote from the Wired article referenced above., Elon Musk's behavior borders on madness at times (too often, actually). He certainly has demonstrated an alarming degree of immaturity in his dealings with the SEC and he uses Twitter and media interviews to indulge in reckless taunts and insults that provide no benefit to the company. He can be petulant, rude and, according to the Wired article, at times abusive. These are all well-known negatives and part of the bear case against TSLA, i.e. an out of control, self-destructive CEO who will surely not succeed. Despite all the outlandish behavior, as the quote above succinctly states, TSLA has a string of accomplishments to its credit. If it can continue to grind out increases in production rates, improvements in quality, and reductions in cost, it will stay cash flow positive and be able to fund its growth., The slicing in half of the U.S. electric vehicle tax credit beginning Jan. 1, 2019, on electric vehicles sold by TSLA must harm, to some extent, the incremental demand for the Model 3. To argue otherwise would be to reject economic theory on price vs. demand dating back to Adam Smith. A decrease in demand growth, however, should not be conflated with a decline in demand. Sales volume will likely grow during 2019 despite the halving of the tax credit. Why? Because, despite some of the problems with the fit and finish of the Model 3, it is an appealing, high-quality product that is fun to drive (particularly compared with other products in the price range) that early adopters (they come after the Innovators in the adoption life cycle) will embrace., Lastly, there's the specter of imminent competition. There's plenty of room for debate about when and how effective that competition will be, but, sometime over the next three years, at least a couple of the traditional car manufacturers (domestic and international) will have competitive products that will be introduced at least in the high-end market to compete with the S and X. TSLA will not remain static. It will continue to make progress on battering down costs, automating production, and reducing the cost of its vehicles. In addition, the more electric vehicles out in the wild on the roads of the U.S., Europe, China and the rest of the world, the greater the size of the addressable market since it will accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles. The best advertising is the product on the road., All of these negatives are well known and hotly debated. If in doubt, just look at the quantity of articles published daily on Seeking Alpha arguing the bull or the bear side of the debate. Despite this cloud of negativity, TSLA's stock price reversed hard beginning late October and has withstood the buffeting of a general market decline., Q3 2018 earnings are increasingly looking like a critical milestone for TSLA. In a nonlinear, frustratingly zig-zag pattern, TSLA was able to grind out sufficient advances in the rate of the production of the Model 3 to begin generating cash on a consistent basis (still to be confirmed by Q4 and Q1 results). TSLA has fallen short of its goal to achieve its target of a $35k Model 3 for the mass market and the company has too often over promised and under delivered (way too often). The market is turning a blind eye to this, however, and is focusing on where the company is going. The stock market, after all, is a discounting mechanism and it's currently indicating confidence that TSLA will survive and continue to generate free cash flow in the near term., Similar to how many analysts value (potentially) high-growth companies, Oppenheimer justifies its price target by looking out three years to project earnings, applying a multiple, and discounting back to bet a 12-month price target. $21 of EPS with 250 million shares outstanding (my wild guess estimate, there are 171.7 million currently outstanding) implies net income of $5.25 billion. This seems pretty ambitious as does the 25x multiple. The stock feels overvalued, but the stock always has been overvalued from the beginning. If TSLA hits Oppenheimer's Q4 production estimates of 66k, the stock is not going to trade down. To believe that the stock is going to decline meaningfully from here, an investor must believe that TSLA will miss Q4 production estimates., As to what the future holds? That brings us back to this quote:, “For me, the fact that we were able to build at scale, amid all that craziness, that’s the real accomplishment,” one former engineering executive told me. “Just think about it: We designed a car that is so simple and elegant you can build it in a tent. You can build it when your CEO is melting down. You can build it when everyone is quitting or getting fired. That’s a real accomplishment. That’s amazing.”, For all the insanity that has occurred at TSLA, Musk has still built an impressive company., , ",,"Tesla provided notice to the 2019 Convertible Notes holders that the Convertible Notes will be settled with a 50/50 mix of cash and stock at maturity on March 1, 2019., The notification to the Convertible Notes holders was required to be issued by Dec. 1 and was not an attempt at stock price goosing by Tesla., The cash flow positive Q3 2018 was an important milestone and management's optimism about consistently generating free cash marks an inflection point for the company., If Q4 earnings show a modest amount of positive cash flow after redemption of the 2018 Converts, it will reinforce investor belief in the financial survival of TSLA."

(TSLA)",,Tesla: The Short Thesis Is Dying,"I have been covering Tesla (, ) privately for the last year and a half to two years, watching as the stock was able to somehow soar despite worsening financial erosion. Profitability was rare, and a one-off event. For the most part, I loved the product but never touched the stock on the long side or the short side., On the other hand, there have been bolder and extremely intelligent investors like Jim Chanos and David Einhorn who have placed short bets against Tesla. Both managers have bet against massive failures, with Jim Chanos betting against Enron, and David Einhorn betting against Lehman Brothers. To put it simply, I believe these two managers and the majority of the short selling community on Tesla is smart. I just think that they are wrong., This article is an attempt on my part to see the legitimacy of certain aspects of the Tesla short thesis while scrutinizing other aspects of the Tesla short thesis to bring a more balanced risk assessment to Tesla. In no way, shape, or form is this article intended to be hostile towards individual short sellers named within its contents., There is a saying I like to employ with the executive departures that go as follows:, Once is happenstance,, Twice is coincidence,, Three times is a trend., As of September, 41 executives had departed Tesla year-to-date. Since then, many more executives have left. Most recently, Tesla's head of global security left the firm. While having so many executives flea the company initially seems like a negative, we need to gain more perspective. There are three reasons that these departures aren't as important as they may seem:, If the rate of change in Tesla's executive departures remains flat or increases, then I am open to changing my stance on this prong of the bear thesis. That being said, 41 executive departures year-to-date is a scary number., Bears have said that Tesla is lagging the competition in the autonomous driving arena, with competitors like Waymo and, in Stage 4 of autonomous driving, nearing regulated deployment, while Tesla is in Stage 2-3. I agree with many in the automotive industry that autonomous driving will play an essential role in the future of mobility. The market leaders in this space are the ones set to thrive in this next tectonic shift in the auto market. The question is, who are the leaders?, If you listened to the bears and skeptics, you would say that Tesla is not a market leader in autonomous driving. Skeptics have cited crashes where the automobile is on Autopilot mode, raising safety concerns. While these concerns are valid, if we look back at the history of automobiles, we see that when first created, cars were much more risky and prone to defects than the previous transportation standard of the time, namely horses. As a technology progresses, it improves. With a machine learning program like Autopilot, with more experience, the algorithm gets smarter., Tesla's competition is not absent from these accidents, with Alphabet's (, ) (NASDAQ:, ) Waymo and Uber both witnessing crashes. And while the frequency of accidents with the Autopilot is larger, there is an elevated number of total Teslas on the road activating Autopilot than there are Waymo enabled autonomous driving cars. The fact that Teslas are ""out in the wild"" is what progresses accidents, which are speed bumps (no pun intended), but not roadblocks for future technological development., Then there is the total number of miles accrued. For the sake of simplicity, Waymo is in the millions of miles whereas Tesla is in the billions., (Source:, ), (Source:, ), In the autonomous driving market, similar to the advertising market, data is what will propel certain platforms to market leadership roles. With automobiles, data is collected mostly via miles driven to boost machine learning performance., Another interesting thing to note is that if a Tesla Network (something that Elon Musk has hinted at) is developed, Tesla has delivered 362,133 vehicles as of Q3, with the Model 3 production ramp only now beginning to take effect. 49,366 of these Teslas have been sold without autopilot hardware. As of now, Tesla has 312,767 vehicles with Autopilot hardware installed. This number will only continue to grow as Tesla ramps Model 3 production and focuses on other models. Once Tesla works out autonomous driving software, they already have a fleet with installed hardware to update with new autonomous driving software capabilities. No other automaker on the market has that., Finally, Tesla is continuing to update this already phenomenal hardware. The next time Tesla revamps its processor technology, they will begin designing in-house processors that, according to Tesla, have 10x the performance of their previous Nvidia (, ) counterpart while costing the same amount to produce. While Hardware 3 as it is called is yet to hit the road, once this autonomous hardware does hit the road, offerings from Nvidia and Intel's (, ) Mobileye will be much less efficient and powerful that Hardware 3., One of the greatest pillars of the Tesla short thesis is the competitive threat posed by other automakers. Bears always cite the plethora of electric vehicle competition coming onto the markets in the next several years as a key concern with Tesla's ability to perform well financially. I, about why I believe the competition argument on Tesla is invalid. I believed, and still do, that the competition is far behind Tesla in almost every single way., There are a few key points behind my belief that the competition is invalid., Firstly, back when Tesla's Model S and Model X hit the market, the bear thesis was not that the competition from other EVs would eat into Tesla's overall sales, but that Tesla was the laughing stock of the auto world and would not prove any threat to the sales of other ICE based cars. Since Tesla has gained prominence, its stock price and unit sales have soared, while simultaneously scaring legacy automakers into investing the EV wave. Tesla has single-handedly shifted the mindset of the auto industry, with legacy auto now recognizing how big a threat Tesla is to their business., In my opinion, Tesla has many competitive advantages over legacy autos EVs. The first of which is Tesla's Supercharger technology., If you didn't know, the Tesla Supercharger network is a network of charging stations that allows Tesla owners to recharge their vehicles on the go. Tesla's Supercharger network can be thought of as a network of ""gas stations""., When Tesla first brought their Tesla Roadster to the market, there was no way for owners to go on road trips because of the lack of charging availability. As such, Tesla has brought these charging stations to the market. Tesla has spent hundreds of millions on this infrastructure. Tesla now has a vast amount of charging stations., (Source:, ), This allows Tesla owners to have the optionality of road trips and not be constrained by charging or lack thereof. Tesla continues to push for increased availability of these chargers, continuing further expansion in North America, and moving into markets like Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. And while there is competition to Tesla in charging technology coming from established automakers, developing a massive charging network will not happen overnight. Even then, Tesla has openly offered electric vehicles from other automakers the rights to charge on Tesla's infrastructure, a proposal that automakers have not taken Tesla up on. The bulk of this electric charging competition is coming from Europe, with legacy auto rushing to develop a lead against Tesla's massive European charging operation. This competition is virtually an exact replication of Tesla's technology while being six years behind Tesla in overall development of this network. While eventually, the competition may catch up with Tesla in the charging field, the Supercharger Network will remain a moat for a while., Secondly, Tesla has developed a moat in its Tesla stores. These stores are strategically placed much like an Apple (, ) store, in high-end locations emphasizing Tesla as a quality brand., (Source:, ), Tesla's stores offer a clean, nice, and simple look into the luxurious products that Tesla offers, with people being drawn in to look at the cars. Think about it. Would you rather go into an auto dealership or a Tesla store? On top of that, the current dealership model used by legacy auto is deeply flawed, with the dealerships relying on high maintenance fees they would normally collect with an internal combustion engine (I.C.E) vehicle. Electric vehicles have less parts and are damaged less often, leaving traditional dealerships less incentive to sell EVs in general. Tesla, distributing their products in a vertically integrated manner, allows Tesla to control the sales process of the car, something that the competition is yet to do. Currently, Tesla has 116 showrooms in the US, with some, but far less overseas., Thirdly, Tesla's products are just better. While the competition seems legitimate at a glance, we have to understand that Tesla is not just sitting still. The competition has much to prove. Obstacles like over-the-air updates, production challenges, charging networks, autonomous driving capability, and import tariffs for foreign competition act as obstacles for the competition's relevancy in the EV market. Jaguar, the current threat to the Model X has already faced production delays on its i-Pace SUV, is yet to prove an ability to update hardware OTA and could be subject to import tariffs. Additionally, the product has only begun meaningful production in Europe, with sales in North America being negligible. While heavy economic investment is extremely important in scaling production, experience is even more so. And while Tesla has proven demand for its vehicles, the backlog for competitive cars is nowhere near Tesla's scale., A key problem with the competition belief on Tesla is that it assumes that the current technology Tesla has implemented will not improve over time. Because of Tesla's ability to implement over-the-air updates to its hardware, as Tesla finds efficiencies in its technology, they can use software to upgrade the car overall. So, as time goes on, the car's efficiency increases. So while a car launched in 2020 may be able to compete with Tesla's 2018 range, in 2020, when this competition comes, the technical upgrades implemented will bolster Tesla above the competition. Basically, the competition thesis relies on the belief that Tesla's technology will not improve over time. This assumption is most likely false., Tesla bears and short sellers have called Tesla shares a bubble. Legendary hedge fund manager David Einhorn has but Tesla alongside other high growth names into what he calls his ""bubble basket"". Short-sellers will often make this point about Tesla's valuation:, Competing automakers are trading in the mid-to-high single digit P/E multiples while Tesla trades far higher. This is true. Tesla is trading at a much higher valuation than competitors like Ford (, ) and GM (, )., But to value Tesla's stock against legacy auto firms is an irrational move, as Tesla is very different from its legacy competition. It really comes down to growth., While Tesla does trade at a much higher P/S ratio then Ford and GM, Tesla is growing revenues at 38% in 2019, while GM is flat and Ford is slightly negative. In addition, Tesla operates at ~22% gross margins, GM operates at ~12%, and Ford operates at ~10%. And in terms of solvency, Tesla outperforms the two competitors. And while all three companies have an increased chance of insolvency in the next two years, Ford and GM vastly underperform Tesla. Not to mention, Tesla's solvency is improving with every quarter that goes by as long as the company delivers profits and cash flows. To value Tesla, a growth stock betting on arguably the future of the auto industry against teetering titans like Ford and GM is an irrational move. Simply put, Tesla is a growth company while GM and Ford are in decline. In addition, Tesla is ahead in terms of deployment of electric vehicles versus GM and Ford. In addition, the ICE market is cyclical while EVs continue to take market share, accelerating the deterioration of Ford and GM's business., The bottom line is, if you want to value Tesla's stock, you should value Tesla against growth companies, not legacy automotive peers., In my opinion, Tesla's fundamental story is improving by the quarter, with the company ramping deliveries and will continue to generate profitability and cash. The question is, do the short sellers care? Despite Tesla's profitable Q3, short interest is yet to meaningfully decrease, still making up ~25% of the total float. Since October 31st, Tesla's short interest is down only 3.8%. There have been many articles on Seeking Alpha skeptical of Tesla's business, with the short selling community remaining vocal. The core belief is that Tesla will not be sustainably profitable beyond Q3's $2.90/share and $881 million in free cash flow. I believe Tesla will continue to report profitability over the next several quarters and will be cash flow positive excluding quarters in which Tesla pays off its creditors. Such a quarter may hit in Q1 of 2019 when Tesla will owe bondholders $920 million if the stock is not at ~$360. If Tesla can turn profits and generate cash in the next couple of quarters, Tesla could face a credit upgrade. And while I am not an expert on the inner workings of credit ratings, I would assume that improving working capital and profitability would help Tesla's credit rating. In Q3, Tesla's working capital improved from -$2.44 billion in Q2 to -$1.86 billion this quarter. If Tesla's credit is upgraded, many concerns of the massive short selling body could be alleviated, leading a substantial amount of the short selling community to cover their short positions., When interviewed by CNBC, a host asked Jim Chanos when he would consider closing his short position. Basically, Chanos said that he would cover his short position once Tesla delivered sustainable profitability. If Tesla racks up quarter after quarter of profitability, the short selling community that views Tesla as a zero may cover out of their short positions. I have seen plenty of commenters on Seeking Alpha calling Tesla's Q3 profits artificial, with the company changing working capital and using tax credits to boost profitability. In reality <10% of total free cash flow came from adjustments in working capital, and only a small sliver of Tesla's overall operating income came from the sale of ZEV and GHG tax credits., All in all, as the fundamental story at Tesla progresses, the short argument will substantially deteriorate. Because the short selling community is so large within Tesla, as the fundamental story plays out, many of the current ~25% of the float will be squeezed out, acting as a catalyst for shares. The bottom line is, the fundamental story is intact (in my opinion). As the short selling community recognizes this, they will cover acting as a price catalyst for the stock., , , I am not a financial adviser. This is not financial advice. Everything said here is my personal opinion. Please do your own due diligence with regards to investments in these securities.",,"Tesla has drastically outperformed the market in the last few months, with the Q3 profitability report. Over the next few quarters, this outperformance will be amplified by a short squeeze., The Tesla short community is made up of extremely smart money managers including Street legends like David Einhorn and Jim Chanos. Simply put, I now believe they are mostly wrong., Tesla short sellers make up ~25% of the float. As fundamentals continue to progress, the bear thesis will continue to crumble, forcing short sellers out of the stock."

(TSLA)",,Tesla: The 60 Minutes Scare,"On Sunday night, CBS show 60 Minutes aired a long interview with Tesla (, ) CEO Elon Musk. The piece covered a lot of topics, from the Model 3's part in the company's near death, to the autopilot feature many consumers want to rely on. In the end, I encourage everyone, , because there are several major red flags that need to be discussed., First of all, Elon Musk came right out and said ""I do not respect the SEC"". He admitted that nobody at Tesla is pre-approving his tweets, which seems to go against the, that specifically says ""Tesla will establish a new committee of independent directors and put in place additional controls and procedures to oversee Musk’s communications."" I don't necessarily argue with his stance that he is protected by the First Amendment, because while he champions Free Speech, he himself has done a lot to shut down critics, like Montana Skeptic who was a prominent contributor to Seeking Alpha., When asked about the new Chairman of the Board put in place, Elon Musk, . He argued that Robyn Denholm was his personal choice, and that she is not there to watch over him. Elon went as so far to say ""I am the largest shareholder in the company, and I can just call for a shareholder vote and get anything done that I want."" Part of the SEC settlement was to bring in two new independent directors to reduce Elon Musk's power over the board, but we are still waiting to find out who those new entrants will be. Corporate governance remains a major red flag at Tesla for now., In regards to his ""timelines"", Elon claims that he's not guaranteeing anything, saying ""how should I know, I've never mass produced a vehicle"". He continues, , and he said that nobody should hold him to his 5-6 month guess for the when the Model 3 version will come at $35,000. If that is the case, why does Tesla still provide a 4-6 month estimate, , a web page that said the same thing two months ago and yet consumers are still waiting. If Elon truly has no idea when things are going to happen, why does the company provide guidance for them and put them on the sales pages? Many consumers thought they would see a $35,000 Model 3 with a $7,500 tax credit, and even though management said it was coming in November 2017, the standard battery version is still nowhere to be found., By the way, while we are talking about Tesla promises, how about the continual one to not raise debt or equity in 2018? Reuters is reporting Monday morning that the, another auto asset-backed bond deal. Tesla's balance sheet was supposed to be strong enough that internally generated cash would be enough to pay for upcoming bond maturities as well as capital expenditures, although the, to settle the March 2019 convertible notes would seem to go against that notion., In less than 4 weeks, the US EV tax credit starts to wind down, and Tesla is already seeing plenty of competition come to market on the high end, in Europe, even with the big headwind coming from the Netherlands. Even on the US East Coast, the performance version of the Model 3 is down to 1-2 week delivery estimates, showing demand has definitely collapsed for certain models. Even the new mid-range version shows a 3 week or less delivery estimate, so Tesla really needs to get the Model 3 to Europe soon or it might need to curtail production in the coming months., Elon Musk talked in the interview about Tesla's ""grand tent"" that saved the company from going bankrupt by boosting Model 3 production substantially. Of course, neither he or the interviewer were wearing any safety goggles on the line, and take a good look at the image below. In the bottom right, you can clearly see a panel gap that shows a defect that we've seen many times with the Model 3. There was no real discussion of quality in the interview, but anyone that spends time on Twitter knows there are, out there., (, Unfortunately, this isn't the only picture from the show that I'd like you to see. As you can see below, Elon Musk provided another demonstration of the company's Autopilot feature. In the first image below, you'll see that Elon has no hands on the wheel, something we've seen him do in the past, which is exactly the opposite of what, . In the second and third images, Elon Musk is demonstrating how the vehicle can change lanes on its own, but you can clearly see it is cutting off another driver and could easily have caused a crash. The pictures might not show the true extent, but if you watch the video, it certainly seems like an accident may occur., Of course, investors should really question what Musk has been telling us for weeks, that the company went from losing $50 million to $100 million a week to profitable in so short a time, and that the tent was the key. Did the, like not painting cars enough? Tesla's service centers are one of its biggest problems, so we may not know for some time the true quality of the Model 3, but there are many, . Tesla prides itself on being so advanced with its factories and technology, yet you can see how much reliance there still is on humans to put vehicles together., I believe that Tesla investors should be even more worried after this weekend's 60 Minutes interview with Elon Musk. With the CEO making some harsh comments regarding the SEC, the governing agency might wish to review its settlement and be tougher on the name moving forward. Also, I worry that the autopilot system in current form leaves the name open to legal liability thanks to Elon Musk's ""no-hands"" pictures, especially, this view in court., With more and more weak registration data coming in from Europe, as well as delivery estimates for the Model 3 in the US collapsing, I remain worried about Tesla's situation as we head into 2019. While I don't see the 60 Minutes piece as a ""one smoking gun"" item that could completely take down the name, it's another incremental risk that investors need to put on their plate when deciding what to do with Tesla. I could see shares topping out in the coming weeks as they approach their all-time highs, especially since they have soared in recent months while, that there has been material improvement made., , ",,"The 60 Minutes interview exposes some major red flags., Elon Musk has no regards for authority or consumers., Autopilot liability may be substantial moving forward."

(Podcast),"The one question that I asked myself after watching Elon Musk's interview on 60 Minutes this past Sunday was ""How long is he going to be able to tempt fate and get away with it?"", The Tesla (, ) CEO's interview on CBS Sunday night raised many red flags – some of which have already been elaborated on in Bill Mauer's great article located, – and others I brought up during my most recent podcast that I taped on Monday night., One of the first things I wanted to address is how clearly Elon Musk appears to be stating that he is not abiding by the court ordered SEC settlement agreement. He made it clear during the 60 Minutes interview that the new chair of his board doesn’t have any control over him and that he is not having his public communication regarding the company double checked before he publishes it. These were two key parts to his settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission., (Source:, ), On top of that, Musk joked around about the time deadline for the $35,000 Model 3. To me, if I were a reservation holder who had been waiting for this vehicle for more than two years, I would not find this a laughing matter. Musk's cavalier tone was a huge red flag in my opinion and could be indicative of a broader attitude problem at the company overall. I talked about this as well during my podcast., Finally, I wanted to explore how long Musk might be able to get away with making these types of cheeky remarks and poking regulators without paying the consequences. As Jim Cramer even said on Monday, Musk obviously thinks he is above the law. Do you think that’s the case? Here’s my most recent thoughts on the issue., To subscribe to future podcasts, you can, to go through Podbean or, to subscribe on the Apple iTunes store.

(TSLA)",,Elon Musk On 60 Minutes: More Than An SEC Fight,"Apparently, Elon Musk just cannot help himself when it comes to goading the SEC. In an, , Tesla’s (, ) mercurial CEO seemed to violate or invalidate, of his, with the SEC over the “, ” fiasco of earlier this year:, Elon stated that he picked Robyn Denholm to take the top board job himself, before then announcing that, as the largest shareholder, he has effective control and can do as he pleases without fear of being reined in by the board., Elon informed Lesley Stahl that he has not once been censored and that his Twitter activity is protected by the First Amendment. Furthermore, he claimed that “mistakes” might occur in the future, meaning he can still post market-moving tweets without oversight., Elon did one better than calling the suit into doubt; he stated explicit contempt for the regulatory agency: “, ”., Elon’s latest interview joins a litany of, this year. But his outrageous frontal assault on the SEC certainly makes many of his other strange moves pale in comparison. As Bill Maurer has, on Seeking Alpha, and we have, elsewhere, the consequences for Elon and Tesla could be severe if the SEC is moved to act on this latest provocation. The SEC agreed to settle and move on, which saved Tesla from a, . Yet, while the SEC has, to date, even after Elon’s Twitter rant in which he dubbed the agency the “, ”, it will not likely be able to brush off such a flagrant and public disparagement of its authority., Furthermore, while the reignition of SEC conflict captured most of the media bandwidth, there were other interesting revelations. One such revelation involved the long-promised standard range Model 3 sedan, which is meant to retail starting at $35,000. On 60 Minutes, Elon confirmed yet again that, . Furthermore, he seemed to push out the date of its arrival yet again., The $35,000 price tag has been an essential selling point of the Model 3 since it was first unveiled in 2016. It is supposed to carry Tesla into the mass market. But that dream appears to remain stalled, which bodes ill for a stratospheric share price., Let’s discuss the consequences of Elon’s latest revelation regarding the mass-market Model 3., As we discussed in our last article on the subject of the elusive standard range Model 3, cost is still a huge issue. On the Q3 earnings call on October 24th, CFO Deepak Ahuja admitted the mass-market Model 3 was, . But the day was meant to be near at hand when it would be. On the same call, Elon declared:, “We're probably less than six months from that”., In the December 9th interview, Elon gave an update on the $35,000 Model 3, claiming it would be available in “, ”. That actually sounds (almost) in line with Elon’s October estimates. But, as ever with Elon and Tesla, there is more to it than that., While claiming that the $35,000 Model 3 would probably be available mid-year, Elon was uncharacteristically cagey. Indeed, after stating the “fix or sixth months” estimate, he immediately hedged, saying “That’s just my guess”. When Stahl pressed him further, he got even cagier:, “Punctuality is not my strong suit...Just because I’m dumb at predicting dates doesn’t mean I’m untruthful”., Clearly, Elon is not willing to go on the record with his estimate, which is a rarity for the ever-optimistic CEO. It is a far-cry from the Elon of August 2017 who stated unequivocally that investors should have “, ” that Tesla would be producing 10,000 Model 3 sedans per week by the end of 2018. That prediction, like so many others made by Elon, proved wildly off the mark. Indeed, Model 3 production, . According to Bloomberg’s Model 3 Tracker, production is now - in the closing days of 2018 -, ., What can we make of this uncharacteristic uncertainty?, Well, for one thing, it appears that the folks waiting for the $35,000 Model 3 may be waiting for quite a while longer. That is trouble for Tesla, given the apparent evaporation of the much vaunted multi-year backlog. Indeed, Tesla has finally been compelled to admit that it has, of its existing all-wheel-drive Model 3, as well as its higher-priced Model S and Model X. It may not be surprising, then, that production has stalled., A planned push into Europe in February may help find some demand for the high-margin Model 3, but that depends on homologation in the European Union - something that is still an open question. We will only know for certain whether the Model 3 has been successfully homologated in January., Reservation holders and would-be buyers of the $35,000 Model 3 also face a time crunch. Tesla passed the 200,000 vehicle threshold this year that begins the phaseout of the $7,500 FIT credit that serves to significantly cut the effective price paid by consumers., Would-be buyers thought they were getting a Tesla for $27,500. Now, at best, they will be paying $31,250. But by the end of 2019, the credit will be gone. That means trouble for Tesla as lower-priced competitors come to market. The Audi e-Tron, for example, will have a lower topline price and buyers will get to enjoy the full tax credit. For the would-be Tesla owners who expected a better bargain, other EV options will undoubtedly prove increasingly tempting., Tesla's stock has enjoyed a tremendous upward run since reporting blowout earnings in Q3. A large number of short sellers have covered their positions. But that quarter was, thanks to an absolute focus on the highest-margin Model 3 orders,, . A lower priced mid-range Model 3, in the mix since October, will likely pull that figure down in Q4, even if Tesla manages to further trim production costs overall. Q1 will likely prove even harsher to margins - and the cash requirements of the March convertible will also likely cause, ., Likewise, the benefits of high-margin European (and, later, Chinese) sales will help buoy margins for a time. But pricing pressure from competition and the evaporating tax credit will, ultimately, cause problems for Tesla's bottom line., The effort to cut the cost of the Model 3 is a race against time. Even if it stays on track, the Model 3 will still face harsh pressure from new competition. If Tesla ends up delaying the $35,000 version yet again, as seems increasingly likely, it could scupper the company’s hopes of being a true mass-market EV player for the long-run., , ",,"The Tesla CEO made fresh waves in a Dec. 9 interview with 60 Minutes; the big highlight was his statement regarding the SEC: “I do not respect them""., While this statement garnered a raft of headlines and criticism, it was not the only revelation of the evening; Elon also discussed the long-awaited $35,000 Model 3., While Elon said he still expected the standard range Model 3 to reach buyers in 5-6 months, he took great pains to assert this estimate was just his ""guess""., Elon’s uncharacteristic caginess regarding the $35,000 Model 3 is yet another signal that the promised standard range version is in trouble., Without a mass-market Model 3, Tesla’s growth prospects will be severely truncated."

(TSLA)",,Tesla: A Costly Legal Battle?,"Sometimes I wonder if there is a lack of communication across the higher up ranks at Tesla (, ). While everyone knows that CEO Elon Musk is deeply involved in the overall business, perhaps not every decision made comes directly from him. On Tuesday, an interesting lawsuit the company is now involved in was detailed, which seems to bring up major legal questions for the CEO and the stock., This afternoon, CNBC reported, former employee and reported whistle blower Martin Tripp for $167 million. Mr. Tripp has claimed that Tesla used poor manufacturing processes at the gigafactory, and may have potentially put damaged battery modules into some Model 3 vehicles. Tesla has disputed these claims, and Elon Musk has, against Mr. Tripp during this process. Mr. Tripp's attorney provided the following quote in the CNBC article:, The purported damage amount claimed by Tesla relates to supposed dips in Tesla’s stock price by virtue of the information Mr. Tripp provided to the press last summer., It makes complete sense for any company to seek damages if it believes that false information detailed by one or more parties caused its stock price to decline. I totally understand that. However, by arguing this stance, the company seems to be throwing its own CEO and perhaps itself under the bus, based on the following famous tweet that is now the subject of investor lawsuits, ., (, Now the Tesla lawsuit discussing share price equals about a $1 move in the stock based on the current outstanding share count. If that is what the company is arguing for in terms of damages against Mr. Tripp, what are the potential damages for the ""funding secured"" tweet that sent the stock soaring into the $380s only to drop more than $30 in the coming days seen below? Remember, there were about 170.6 million shares outstanding for Tesla as of July 27th, according to its, ., (, Using Tesla's own logic, lawsuits against Elon Musk (and perhaps the company) could thus have several billions in potential damages. Remember, there are two sides to this trade. First, you have those who bought based on the notion that Tesla was going private at $420, and have experienced losses as the stock fell as doubt grew. Longs could also argue that they were basing their purchases on a potential $420 sales price, arguing for damages up to that deal price point. On the other hand, you have short sellers that covered on the sharp rise or to avoid further losses thinking the stock was going to $420. Those short sellers may have held onto their positions longer without the famous tweet. One, detailed a ""Class Period"" that went from August 7th to August 14th, for example, which could easily encompass thousands of investors, long and short., Now for argument's sake, let's separate Tesla the company from all of this, and only focus on Elon Musk for now. If he were to be on the hook for major damages, how would he pay for all of this? He has already, of his holdings of Tesla shares as collateral for several personal loans, and he has bought more shares and led a SpaceX funding round since the latest pledging data was revealed in April. Are banks going to allow him to put down more collateral, or are they going to force a margin call to make him pay these damages? Obviously, a situation where Elon Musk is forced to sell Tesla shares would not be good for the stock., We knew after events from earlier this year that there would be a major legal battle between Tesla and Martin Tripp. While Mr. Tripp claims to be a whistle blower and, proof of his claims, Tesla says he is a hacker and has leaked false information to the press. The company is suing Mr. Tripp for $167 million in damages related to all of this, but its main argument would seem to put Elon Musk on a major hook for damages related to his funding secured tweet that caused a much larger move in Tesla's stock price. Do you believe Tesla is making the right decision here, or will this result in a costly legal battle for Elon Musk and the company? I look forward to your comments below., , ",,"Company suing Martin Tripp for $167 million., Basis is false information leaked to press., What does this mean for the ""funding secured"" tweet."

(TSLA)",,Projecting Tesla's Fourth Quarter Results: Boom Or Bust?,"Now that we are two months into the quarter, we have more information on how Tesla (, ) is doing in the final leg of 2018. Using a proprietary model, I have used this new information, along with some assumptions about December, to project out the fourth quarter results. Extrapolating these numbers out results in a profitable quarter for Tesla that has upwards potential if a few of my assumptions are too conservative. I predict earnings will be around $80 million for the quarter, with the potential to reach up to $150 million with margin improvements., I have built a basic model that projects out earnings based on auto sales, average sales price, and gross margins. I calibrated the model using information from prior 2018 quarterly 10Qs (, ,, ,, ), investor update letters for margin info (, ,, ,, ), and various sources around average sales price and sales/production volumes that I will highlight below., My model focuses solely on the auto sales side of the books and takes the rest of the information for granted (energy revenues/expenses, SGA and interest expense, etc.). For future periods, I either hold the values level or increase them as a measure of conservatism (for expense-related items). This allows me to get a decent look at what the next few quarters earnings might look like with very few assumptions. Over time, I plan to expand out the model to incorporate more aspects of the business such as capex spending, new models coming online, increased production capacity, expansion of energy business, and scenarios around debt repayment. For now, I ignore these values, as they shouldn't have a large impact on my short term model., Additionally, I remove the ZEV and GHG credits from the bottom line and report those separately, so the reader can include/exclude them from the values as they see fit. While I believe that these credits will continue in the future, they are mandated by the US government and are not within Tesla's control., To calibrate my model, I used the reported earnings from the first three quarters of 2018. I focused on the total automotive revenues and total automotive cost of revenues., To get a baseline, I researched the regulatory credits for each quarter as reported in the 10Qs. In the third quarter, Tesla booked $189 million in regulatory credits with $52 million in ZEV credits and $137 million in GHG credits (, ). These credits are recognized when Tesla sells these to other automakers, and as such, can fluctuate wildly from quarter to quarter. In the second quarter, Tesla has $54 million of regulatory credits (, ), and in the first quarter they booked $80 million (, ). This brings their year-to-date total up to $324 million in credits. Looking back at prior years, the total for regulatory credit sales were $360 million, $302 million, and $169 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015 respectively (, ). In my model, I assume Tesla books another $52 million in ZEV credits in the fourth quarter, making the 2018 total will be $366, which seems a conservative estimate given prior year's growth., The next step was to remove the credits from the automotive revenues to get a cleaner baseline that I could attempt to match. My goal was to replicate the reported auto revenues - credits by taking reported sales times average sales price. Then to replicate reported auto cost of revenues by taking reported sales times average production cost. I used both reported and theorized margins to arrive at the average production costs for each model., I pulled Model 3 average sales price values from, and, . The two estimates were very close (within a thousand dollars each quarter), and I used the values that gave me the best model fit, slightly adjusting the third quarter value downward., Model 3 Average Sales Prices (in thousands), Quarter, CleanTechnica, InsideEVs, Model, 1, 56, 55, 56, 2, 55, 56, 56, 3, 59, 60, 59, (sources:, ,, ), For Model S and X, I assumed that the average sales price of a Model S would be $5,000 less than the Model X, given the higher prices of the Model X. I used information from the second quarter investor update (, ) to note that the ASP of the Models S and X had remained level from first quarter, and from the third quarter investor update (, ) to note that ASP had declined slightly in the third quarter. Calibrating the values with those constraints led me to the following values:, Model S/X Average Sales Prices, Quarter, Model S, Model X, 1, 99, 104, 2, 99, 104, 3, 93, 98, (Source: Tesla, and, I should mention that the ASPs for the Model S and X were the input that I have the least confidence in. I could not find any information about them either officially or unofficially, so I had to back into values. That being said, the values produced seem reasonable given the starting prices of those models., The next item to validate was cost of automotive revenue. I did not find any high variance pieces of the costs, so there was no need to adjust the report values as I did with the regulatory credits and automotive revenue. I used margin information from the first, second, and third quarter updates to arrive at the following values, Model S, Model X, Model 3, Quarter, COGS, Margin, COGS, Margin, COGS, Margin, 1, 71, 28.3%, 74.5, 28.4%, 75, -33.9%, 2, 71, 28.3%, 74.5, 28.4%, 56, 0.0%, 3, 66.5, 28.5%, 70, 28.6%, 47.2, 20.0%, (Source: Margin estimates from Tesla updates in, ,, ,, ), I was now able to validate my results against the reported values., For first quarter, the reported total auto revenues were $2.735 billion with $80 million in regulatory credits. Without the credits, the total revenues were $2.655 billion. The model has $1.161 billion in Model S revenue, $1.047 billion in Model X revenue, and $458 million in Model 3 revenue for a total of $2.666 billion in revenue. The modeled revenue for first quarter is within 0.5%, coming in $11 million high., For second quarter, the reported revenues were $3.358 billion and regulatory credits were $54 million. Revenue without credits totaled $3.304 billion. The model has $1.082 billion in Model S revenue, $1.182 billion in Model X revenue, and $1.033 billion in Model 3 revenue for a total of $3.297 billion in revenue. The modeled revenue for first quarter is within 0.2%, coming in $7 million low., Finally, for the third quarter, the reported revenues were $6.099 billion and regulatory credits were $190 million. Revenue without credits totaled $5.909 billion. The model has $1.346 billion in Model S revenue, $1.293 billion in Model X revenue, and $3.295 billion in Model 3 revenue for a total of $5.933 million in revenue. The modeled revenue for first quarter is within 0.5%, coming in $24 million high., (Source:, and personal model), Repeating the exercise for costs of auto revenue gives you the following results (in millions)., Costs of auto revenue modeled results (in billions), Quarter, Model S, Model X, Model 3, Total, Reported, % Difference, 1, 0.833, 0.750, 0.614, 2.197, 2.196, 0.0%, 2, 0.776, 0.847, 1.033, 2.656, 2.667, -0.4%, 3, 0.962, 0.923, 2.636, 4.521, 4.525, -0.1%, (Source:, and personal model), Now that the model is calibrated, we can use the values that we have built to make some assumptions about the fourth quarter and come up with a range of potential results. But before we can do that, a round of caveats is in order., The inputs that we must now focus on are sales, average sales price, and margin (and cost of goods sold). For sales, I referenced a few online estimators for Model 3 sales and averaged them., estimates Model 3 production (which is a semi-decent proxy for sales), while, estimates sales of all 3 models in the US. Neither are perfect for our needs but serve as a decent baseline. Bloomberg estimated 20,623 Model 3s produced in October and 18,765 in November. InsideEVs estimated 17,750 Model 3s sold in the US in October and another 18,650 in November. While InsideEVs estimates only include US sales, this does not impact Model 3 appreciably as only Canada is currently getting Model 3 deliveries outside the US. I took an average of the two estimates and used 19,186 for October and 18,707 for November. This left December as an estimation. Given the holidays and the unique circumstances around the change in tax credit (unable to rush deliveries as orders would have been locked in a month in advance), I do not expect a large bump in sales in the final month of the quarter as in third quarter. I conservatively estimate the December sales to be around 19,000, making the overall Model 3 sales for the quarter 57,000., For Model S and X sales, I referenced the, estimates again, but had to gross up the numbers. Based on prior quarters estimates vs. reported sales (, ,, ,, ), it appears that half of Model S/X sales are outside the US. I adjusted the estimates for Model S/X upwards by a factor of 2 to come up with a worldwide estimate, resulting in 2,700 Model S sales in October and 5,500 in November. Model X estimations were 2,450 in October and 6,400 in November. I assumed that December sales would be equal to September sales, despite the upward growth shown in the first two months of the quarter. This results in 7,500 Model S sales in December and 7,950 Model X sales, bringing the fourth quarter totals for Model S to 15,700 and Model X to 16,800. This would represent a total of 104,260 Model S/X sales for the year, above Tesla's guidance of 100,000 in the third quarter update., For my average sales price assumption, I assumed the Model S and X values would remain the same as third quarter (93 and 98 respectively), and the Model 3 values would decrease from 59 in the third quarter to 55 in the fourth quarter., I assumed the margin on Model S and X also would remain flat from the third quarter, while the Model 3 margin would move up 1% to 21%. This reflects my belief that increased efficiencies in the production line will outstrip the reduction in margin due to lower trim mix. Tesla has proven capable of this in the past year with their improved Model S/X margin despite a lower ASP., Using these assumptions, I come up with an automotive revenue of $6.242 billion (up 5.2% from third quarter) and a cost of automotive revenue of $4.700 billion. This would result in a net income (ignoring other factors I touch on below) of $243 million. Comparing apples to apples, this net income for third quarter was roughly $149 million (after removing the $190 million of regulator credits). For the fourth quarter, I expect regulatory credits will add another $152 million to the income. This puts the overall results right to a $395 million profit for the quarter, The one thing I did not factor into my model was the effect of the US trade war with China. In the third quarter update, Tesla estimated a $50 million effect to the bottom line (, ). This would still result in Tesla posting a profit in the fourth quarter if my numbers are right, which is in line with their third quarter guidance., I do believe there's some conservatism in my model. The Model 3 sales numbers did not include Canadian sales, and in the third quarter that estimated to be 3% more sales. Adding 1,710 sales to the Model 3 projection adds $20 million in net income. Model S/X sales grew by 8% in the first two months of the fourth quarter compared to the first two months of the third quarter. If we assume the same 8% growth for the final quarter, there would be 1,236 more Model S/X sales, increasing the profit by $34 million. Additionally, every 1% of margin improvement on the Model 3 adds roughly $34 million in profit., On the downside, a condensed timeline for Gigafactory 3 could push capex spending that was anticipated to happen in 2019 in the fourth quarter results. The trade war with China could have a larger impact than anticipated (although given InsideEVs estimations on Model S/X sales, I don't believe this will be true). Margins on the Model 3 decrease as the average sales price dips (a 1% dip in margin moves the bottom line around $34 million). Decreased demand in the final month due to uncertain delivery time frames reduces the overall sales for the quarter (dips in sales would show similar, negative moves as increases in sales listed above)., Beyond the auto portion of the statement of operations, I currently do not feel comfortable making any predictions. The guidance from third quarter was a decrease in revenue and margin on the energy side, and an increase in revenue and margin on the services and other business, mainly due to used car sales. Both of these would push profits higher., With that in mind, I predict earnings will fall around $350 million for the quarter. A result in this range would be a huge win for Tesla especially when you factor in $230 million in debt retired in the quarter as well. Sustained profitability will release much of the pressure on the company and allow them more flexibility going forward. I expect the first quarter of 2019 to be very volatile as Tesla attempts to deal with the logistics of delivering 40,000-plus cars overseas, while managing Gigafactory 3's construction, paying off $920 million in, , and a potential ramping up of solar roof production. In future articles I will expand the model to project out results under various scenarios., , ",,"Information is now available for delivery estimates for October and November., Backing out GHG and ZEV credits allows us to better model the correlation between average sales price and revenues/margins., Projecting out December results predicts another profitable quarter for Tesla, although not as large as third quarter's final number."

(TSLA)",,Tesla: An Unlikely Beacon Of Light In A Very Stormy Market,"Amongst a sea of red tape, one unlikely company has continued to shine bright throughout the recent stock market correction. Despite the carnage and the incredible volatility in the broader market, of all the unlikely candidates,, has managed to maintain its momentum., Why is one of the, companies in the world (, ) holding up so well in the face of so much adversity for stocks? Perhaps more importantly, are there legitimate catalysts capable of driving Tesla shares substantially higher from current levels?, In this article I discus several potential reasons why Tesla has held up so well during the recent correction and why this stock is likely headed higher, especially longer term., Something happened in October when Tesla delivere GAAP net income of, . Before this, there were questions whether Tesla could indeed transition into a profitable, economically viable enterprise. I believe those questions were answered in October when Tesla delivered its, ., The company accomplished two very important elements. First, Tesla significantly cut costs, illustrating to the market that the company is quite capable of controlling its finances. Both R&D expenses and SG&A costs were reduced QoQ, which came as quite a surprise to many market participants, suggesting that the company can be much more efficient than previously realized., and SG&A expenses were reduced by about 2.8%. Moreover, this was achieved while the company delivered more than, and increased revenues by about 72%, which is nothing short of remarkable., On the flip side of this equation, Tesla became substantially more profitable on the production side of its business. The company’s combined automotive gross margin surged, . Furthermore, Tesla’s overall gross margin rose sharply by about 45% QoQ from just 15.4% in Q2, to 22.3% in Q3., The most notable improvements in gross margin came in energy generation and storage, which increased from 12% to 17.2% QoQ, and the Model 3 segment which skyrocketed from just about 3% in Q2, to an, ., Tesla essentially demonstrated to the market that it can be a lot more efficient than many market participants had anticipated. Remember, one of the primary short arguments is that Tesla is a non economically viable cash burning train wreck. Well, now the company has illustrated a clear ability to not only control expenses but also reduce costs substantially when need be., Furthermore, the company has illustrated a drastic improvement in operational and manufacturing efficiency by improving Model 3 gross margins considerably. Therefore, as the company’s economies of scale capabilities continue to improve Tesla will likely continue to become more efficient and much more profitable over time., Gigafactory 3 that Tesla is building in China is an incredibly pivotal project. This endeavor is so crucial for Tesla because China is by far the biggest and most explosive EV market in the world. EV sales have gone up, , and experts are expecting 40% YoY market share growth to continue for the next few or several years., Gigafactory 3 will be Tesla’s first hub in China, with the country essentially serving as the gateway to the entire Asian car market. Furthermore, production is expected to start much sooner than anticipated, with partial, ., Eventually Tesla's Gigafactory 3 is expected to be putting out 250,000 - 500,000 vehicles annually. Shanghai also is projected to be the home for, , expected to go into assembly in 2020., Right now, there's very little as far as potential competition goes in the 100% EV premium performance car market. For instance, Jaguar I-Pace only sold a, worldwide in September. It's true that the vehicle is still early in its production cycle, but at the same time Tesla's 100% EVs are experiencing very strong demand and are registering sales in the tens of thousands., The Model 3 vehicle sold about, alone in the month of September. The Model X, Tesla’s SUV which is a better direct competitor to the I-Pace, sold close to 4,000 units in the month of September., Other real 100% EV performance competitors are expec, and others are not projected to be available until late next year, to early 2020. Also, it's not clear in what capacity they will be produced, given the fact that legacy automakers are still overwhelmingly geared toward ICE vehicle sales and their EV lineups will likely cannibalize sales., This is a big issue for traditional automakers that widely gets overlooked. Most have invested numerous billions into costly ICE engine plants, transmission factories, etc. Huge facilities that are essentially geared entirely toward ICE vehicle production. And now their proposed EV lineups will take away sales and profitability from their lucrative ICE segments., Furthermore, most of the proposed “competition” appears to be aimed at the Model X, with very limited competition toward the Model S and almost no real competition for the Model 3., Sure, some people may say that the, is preparing to launch is aimed to compete with the Model 3. However, I will argue that based on its appearance, likely performance, and so on, this vehicle is more of a competitor for the BMW I3, Nissan Leaf (, ), and the Toyota Prius (NYSE:, ) than it is a true competitor for the Model 3., Another month, another dominant quarter for Tesla and its Model 3 vehicle. The Model 3 sold an approximate, , reportedly surpassing its three nearest competitors combined in the small and midsize luxury car market in the U.S., In fact, combined sales for the top four cars in this group Mercedes C Class, Mercedes E/CLS Class, BMW 5 Series, and Lexus ES came in at 18,447, just slightly above what Tesla’s Model 3 segment sold in the month. Remarkably, the Model 3 reportedly accounted for about 28% of the entire small and midsized luxury car segment (in units) in the U.S. in November (data used provided by, )., Furthermore, it’s not only the Model 3, Tesla’s Model S is the undisputed leader in America’s large luxury car segment, as it comfortably outsold, . Also, Model S and Model X sold an estimated, . Given December is typically a busy month for higher-end Tesla vehicles, Tesla’s Q4 Model S/X sales are likely to be some of the best in the company’s history., In fact, excluding crossovers and SUVs Tesla reportedly led all luxury automakers in the U.S. in November. Tesla delivered an estimated 20,500 Model 3 and Model S vehicles in November, while BMW cars amounted to about 16,511 units and Mercedes Benz sold 14,895 cars in November (data provided by, )., The bottom line is that Tesla continues to lead, substantial 100% performance EV competition is out of the equation for now, and Tesla is likely to replicate its success in other markets like Europe and China going forward., If there's such so much potential in Tesla, why the enormous short position? As of last count, Tesla had, sold short, which equates to roughly $10.7 billion in short interest, making Tesla one of the most heavily shorted stocks in world. Given the circumstances, this is extremely perplexing, but I’ll try to explain., First, I don’t think it’s a good idea to short a company with a revolutionary, market-leading product. Second, I don’t think it's a good idea to short a stock that can potentially increase in value several times over, no matter how remote you think that possibility is. The fact is that it could happen., There are plenty of companies out there that are at the end of their growth stories, peak cycles, etc. And these are likely better stocks to short in my view. Nevertheless, Tesla remains heavily shorted for many reasons., These are just a few of the many examples, but the bottom line is that there are a lot of reasons why someone may want to short Tesla’s stock. However, I will stress that Tesla has shown itself to be extremely resilient over time and has continuously overcome the proverbial wall of worry. I see no reason for the company to behave any differently going forward, and with time short interest is likely to decrease (at least percentage wise)., There’s a reason why Tesla’s stock has performed so well in recent weeks. While numerous growth stories crashed and burned, Tesla’s stayed alive. The company recently illustrated that it's highly capable of controlling and reducing costs, while substantially improving efficiency and profitability simultaneously. Moreover, Tesla’s highly-profitable third quarter implies that the company may become more efficient and more profitable over time., Additionally, the company already is building a second major production facility in China, which essentially opens up the entire Asian market to the company., Tesla is still well ahead of its competition on many fronts in the premium performance 100% EV market. Moreover, legacy automakers have a great deal to lose by introducing substantial EV lineups and are essentially in a no-win situation., The Model 3 continues to dominate sales in its segments, outselling its nearest 3-4 competitors combined. This illustrates incredibly high demand for the vehicle, and demand is likely to remain robust going forward. Additionally, Tesla’s higher priced vehicles Model S and Model X are experiencing strong demand, which implies Q4 could be another profitable quarter., These are the primary reasons why Tesla has performed so well in recent weeks and months. Furthermore, if it weren’t for the correction, Tesla’s stock could be trading at new all-time highs by now., Despite having an overwhelmingly dominant market position in the U.S. EV space, some threats remain for Tesla. One threat is the possibility that such robust Model 3 demand is the result of a massive backlog that's working itself out, and once it's gone, demand could decline. Another concern is that the U.S. market may become over saturated by Tesla vehicles, and Tesla will need to get sales from other, less profitable regions., Yet, another concern is that competition of comparable, new all-electric vehicles will arrive from legacy automakers and will take over Tesla's market share. Another unlikely risk is that the EV movement is a phase and not a revolution and may fizzle out over time., Also, Tesla could file for bankruptcy, capital could dry up, and the company may run out of cash to fund future factories and other endeavors. Tesla also can continue to function without making money, in which case, the company may be doomed to fail. So, risks do exist, but in my view, they are outweighed by the enormous potential that the company is likely to realize in coming years., This article expresses solely my opinions, is produced for informational purposes only, and is not a recommendation to buy or sell any securities.

(TSLA)",,Tesla Likely To Miss Sales Targets For Model 3,"We are nearing the end of the quarter and there is much speculation among Tesla (, ) bears and bulls about sales for Q4 compared to Q3. SA contributor Jonathan Cooper has provided us, , which includes a forecast of 62,255 Model 3., Tesla fan and keeper of the Model 3 tracker spreadsheet,, is forecasting production of 60,359 and deliveries of 60,596 for the quarter., Tesla has guided for higher sales in Q4, but has given no specific estimates., In this article I explain why I think Tesla will miss its targets for Q4, and why I believe sales of the Model 3 will disappoint the bulls., Last July, shortly after Tesla opened its order book to everyone in the US and Canada, the average wait time for a Model 3 was eleven weeks. If new sales were keeping pace with production that wait time would remain the same, but by the end of September it was down to three weeks., Over a period of twelve weeks, Tesla had worked through eight weeks of backlog, implying that new orders during that twelve-week period were equivalent to about four weeks of production, or about 1400 cars per week., The, gives us a wealth of information about Tesla orders and deliveries. We know that new entries in the spreadsheet have been steadily falling, but we don’t know whether that represents a fall in sales or a loss of interest in the spreadsheet. I suspect it is bit of both, and new orders for the LR and AWD variants in Q4 have been well below Q3, perhaps as low as 1,000/week., By mid-October it must have been clear to Tesla that orders for the Model 3 would not keep the production lines running to the end of 2018 when manufacturing for Europe was scheduled to start. Tesla’s answer was to introduce a lower priced variant with a smaller battery., With the final remnants of the backlog being delivered in mid-November and sales of the LR and AWD variants running at 1,000- to 1,500 per week, Tesla needed to sell about 25,000 mid-range Model 3s to keep the production lines running to the end of the year., VINs reported to the tracker spreadsheet give us a means of estimating sales of the mid-range variant. The mid-range Model 3 has been assigned a narrow block of VINs and by examining a sub-set of those VINs we can get an accurate estimate of the participation rate for the spreadsheet (for mid-range buyers)., As of December 11, , there were 108 reported VINs in a range between 151500 and 154500. No new VINs have been reported in that range in the last few days, so we can probably assume that Tesla has allocated all the VINs in that range. We can use that information to calculate the participation rate which comes to 3.6%. There is no bias in that sample, there is no reason to believe that the sample rate for one batch of VINs would be different from another batch, and the sample size is large enough to provide accurate data. There will be inaccuracy if Tesla has not yet allocated all the VIN numbers in the specified range, but that would always result in our sales estimate being in error on the high side., There are a total of 467 entries for the mid-range. Applying the 3.6% participation rate to the full 467 entries would give total sales of (467/.036)= 12,972., However, that number is likely to be too high because 20% of the configuration entries in the spreadsheet never get updated, so we have to adjust the estimate downward by 20% to allow for ""dead"" entries. That gives us a realistic estimate of 10,400 mid-range sales, well short of what is needed., A lot of Tesla buyers placed orders for the Model 3 before the end of September to guarantee delivery for the year end. When new orders fell in the first two weeks of October, Tesla tried to boost the order book by guaranteeing delivery by year end for orders placed by October 15, ., Shortly after the mid-range was introduced that date was revised to November 30, , indicating that initial sales of the mid-range were lower than expected., It now seems that there is plenty of inventory available for immediate delivery, as shown in this image from the Tesla website, taken on December 13th:, If you tell people they need to order by November 30, to guarantee delivery by year end, they tend to do that, so after the cut-off date there are very few buyers left., Since November 30, there have been only 7 entries in the tracker spreadsheet from customers in the USA. Three of those are from buyers of the long-range variant which is no longer produced, four are mid-range and two of those already have an assigned delivery date., New orders for December are likely to be in the low hundreds, for the month., There are signs that Tesla is building up inventory on lots close to the delivery centers throughout the country. The photographs below have been posted on Twitter by interested observers., An estimated 1,000 cars in Illinois alone, including 400 stored on this lot in Chicago:, Another 300 are stored at this location in Tysons’ Corner VA, complete with two small tents, as if they were being set up for a last gasp delivery event. But that event won’t happen because nobody is buying., This batch in Long Island NY also has its own tents. Take a look at the door on that Model X, is it open or closed?, Four hundred cars in a field in Colorado, and more tents:, This is just a sample of an estimated inventory of more than 10,000 Model 3 cars across the United States. That inventory is increasing because sales are lagging behind production., Earlier this quarter Tesla was leaking their weekly production numbers via the Electrek website. Production was tracking similar to Q3 until early November when Electrek reported a fall to 3,500 cars per week. Since then there have been no updates from that particular source, which leads me to believe that the numbers are too low to be leaked., Meanwhile, the Bloomberg tracker is showing a marked decrease in production with numbers below 4,000 in each of the last three weeks and trending downwards., Finally, we have a contribution from @skabooshka who used to provide regular daily updates based on observations of activity at the Fremont plant. His information has proven very accurate in the past, and there is no reason to doubt his figures now, though they pertain only to four days, and may not be representative of ongoing production:, The full impact of the sales trend will not be felt in Q4 because the first two months of the quarter included deliveries of the last remnants of the backlog., I am hesitant to give firm forecasts but I am sure the Tesla bulls want some figures to hang me by if I am wrong, so here are my predictions for Model 3 production and sales for Q4., 10 weeks at 4,300 (same rate as Q3)= 43,000, 3 weeks at current rate of 2,500 (as per @skabooshka) = 7,500, Total, Inside EVs figures for October and November = 36,000, Mid-range deliveries for December (10,400 minus 3,000 delivered in November) = 7,400, Long range and AWD for December (1,000 per week) = 5,000, Total 48,400, which I round up to, to allow for some last minute sales ahead of the FIT credit expiry., Tesla shares have been on a roll since the Q3 financial results were announced. However, those results were based on selling from a Model 3 backlog that had been built over a 2.5 year period, and cherry-picking the high value orders from that backlog. Those results are not sustainable. I expect Q4 to be the first downturn in what has previously been a spectacular period of revenue growth for Tesla., If you own Tesla, why not take your profits now?, , , Short via long term puts",,"Tesla's website tells us that Model 3 is now available for immediate delivery, a strong indication that the backlog is depleted. Ongoing orders are nowhere near enough to sustain production., The lower priced mid-range variant has not provided the sales boost that Tesla needed to keep its lines running at capacity till the end of the year., December sales are lagging because buyers were told they had to order in November to get the full FIT credit., Inventory is building, and production is being reduced., Tesla will likely miss its sales targets for Q4."
