On the other hand Apple traded as low 9.93 in February 2016. What I'm focusing on is that in each of the previous downtrend, the P/E ratio moved below at least 12.0 each time which represented a bottom. From the current price of $168.25 per share, a P/E of 12 implies a stock price of $142.59 which is near where I would be a buyer.

Given expectation of Apple's still strong revenue growth, I don't expect the P/S ratio to collapse to the historical low, but a level 15% lower around 2.75 has precedence.

This growth was generated by Apple's ability to hike ASPs in a dramatic fashion, while unit growth was flat to slightly up. Why? Apple faced a whole slew of factors that allowed the iPhone X to sell extremely well. With the XS/XS MAX/XR cycle, I am not of the belief that Apple can recreate this phenomenal revenue growth into 2019. Let's go over why the iPhone X was able to drive units higher while simultaneously selling the X for $999+.", "There were a whole host of factors that led to iPhone revenues surging. The first factor was the iPhone 6. When the iPhone X was launched, on average, people would use their phones for two years before upgrading to a new iPhone. Two years after the hit revenue from the iPhone 6 was the iPhone X cycle. The iPhone 6 was a hit seller. Buyers of the iPhone 6 were looking to upgrade their phones. The $999 price was irrelevant to the buyers. Why? It could be because of two factors. Firstly, the way Apple unveiled the new iPhone X. Secondly, the iPhone X was a substantial step-up from the previous iPhone 7.", "On the first point, the iPhone X was debuted a full decade after the first iPhone (hence the name). In addition, Apple unveiled the iPhone X in a \"one more thing\" after releasing the iPhone 8, something that has spelled out significant hype in the past from the technological community. They were able to generate enormous hype around the new iPhone that may have helped bolster unit shipments.", "Secondly, Apple had strong technological innovation and design changes in the iPhone X cycle versus the iPhone 7. In addition, true to every product Apple builds, the iPhone X had simplicity in mind. Apple removed the home button, included new FaceID technology, upgraded their Bionic chip, created Portrait mode, improved their screen technology from an LCD screen to OLED. All in all, the iPhone X was a large performance enhancement from the previous iPhone 7.", "The combination of Apple's ability to hype its consumers with technological improvements and a change in the look and feel of an iPhone is what allowed it sell so well.", "(Source: Apple)", "Now, we are looking at the upgrade cycle going from the hit iPhone 6, to the more muted iPhone 6S and iPhone 7 lineup. In 2016, Apple's overall revenues shrunk ~8% Y/Y thanks to a weak iPhone cycle. These are the iPhone owners that are likely to upgrade into the XR/XS/XS MAX cycle.", "Combine that with a lower technological rate of change, with minimal upgrades being made to the iPhone in general, the lofty ASPs on each individual iPhone model will be driving factors against unit shipments. For the iPhone XS and XS MAX, the only real upgrade was the A12 Bionic, the screen size (XS MAX), and the battery (XR/XS/XS MAX). Meanwhile, pricing is relatively unchanged, with the XR at $749, the XS at $999, and the XS MAX at $1,099. That brings me to my next point. iPhone demand is deteriorating, at least for this cycle.", "Since Apple's fiscal Q4 report, evidence is mounting that the newest lineup of iPhones is showing signs of weakness on the demand side.

While 2019 will mark the beginning of the 5G rollout, Apple is holding off until 2020 to launch a 5G smartphone. Why? When a new technological standard is rolled out, the transition from the old standard (4G LTE) to the new standard (5G) isn't a smooth path. Presumably, Apple is giving carriers time to develop their 5G systems and work out the kinks of 5G before deploying 5G into their smartphones.", "In addition, Apple has been using Intel (", ") instead of Qualcomm (", ") in their phones.

Another theory with regards to Apple's 5G deployment or lack thereof is that Intel is coming in late.", "In my opinion, the performance tailwind coming from 5G will be substantial enough to drive significant hardware and software improvements to iPhones that re-excites Apple's loyal fan base into upgrading.", "On top of that, a refresh of an older yet popular phone like the iPhone SE could be a solid selling point in 2020. The iPhone SE is a much-adored phone in the Apple community. Bringing back the iPhone SE (let's call it the iPhone SE 2) and combine it with many of the hardware and software features of the iPhone XR/XS/XS MAX lineup could be a significant sales driver.", "During times of increased technological innovation in the iPhone, we should see accelerated ASP growth. While I do not expect to see the kind of ASP growth we saw with the iPhone X cycle, I do expect Apple to capitalize on their loyal fan base by hiking prices.", "As mentioned in the summary, 59% of Apple's total revenue came from the iPhone in fiscal Q4. Apple is still heavily built around the iPhone. Management, led primarily by CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri, disappointed me and several other followers of and investors in Apple. Why? After the Q4 results, management infamously announced that they would be pulling their reporting of unit shipments from future quarterly disclosures.", "While my fellow bulls have made the argument that Apple is doing this to change Wall Street's perception of what it means to be Apple, I believe that this move catastrophically dents investor confidence in management.", "Bulls will say that Apple moving to pull unit shipment data from releases is just to change the story around Apple from an iPhone company to a more enclosed software/hardware hybrid. This seems rational. Quarter after quarter, the headlines that dominate CNBC are talking about how iPhone missed expectations. Then, when you look at how badly Apple would miss, the margin would be small. After all, Apple did not provide guidance for unit shipments, making it the sell-side's job to look at the supply chain and give educated guesses on unit shipments. So, if Apple missed estimate by 1% or 2% on the shipments side, Wall Street would sell off the stock, and analysts would be swift to downgrade. If Apple forcibly removed reporting of unit sales, the Wall Street would be less focused on the iPhone and more focused on the overall picture at Apple. This would be a significant change in the Apple story and would theoretically reduce volatility in the stock.", "To the contrary, evidence is piling up showing a significant decline in shipments in fiscal Q1 of 2019. Apple's removing of unit disclosure was not upfront. Rather, it was out of the blue. Apple hadn't warned investors previously about pulling unit data and even painted a bright sky for iPhones this cycle.

In my opinion, this is just a big misstep on management's part.", "Since the beginning of Apple's existence, the company's revenue was primarily generated by hardware products. Product innovations like the Apple II, iPod, iPad, and the iPhone have all driven Apple to becoming one of the most relevant companies on earth. Hardware has been Apple's bread and butter since its founding and has driven Apple's financial performance.", "There are two problems with hardware, though. The first is that hardware sales do not generate recurring revenue, being subject to technological innovation cycle after cycle. The second problem is that the gross margins on hardware products are so much lower than software, as the cost of goods sold for a hardware product is so much greater than that of a software product. Even with Apple's use of outsource manufacturing and occasional vertical integration, Apple's hardware business will never have the margins of its software business.", "Apple's services and wearables segments, in particular, have been focused on by investors.

Despite that tremendous growth, these two segments only make up 22% of Apple's overall revenue.", "If we look at Apple's services segment, we can see a distinguishable moat against competition. Platforms like Apple Pay, Apple Music, iCloud, and the App Store are all exclusive to the iOS ecosystem. Because Apple bundles a lot of these platforms into their hardware, they are able to better lock in their users into the Apple ecosystem. That is why there is such a division between iOS and Android. iOS and Android are not just providers of mobile operating systems. Within each of these systems, there are massive digital ecosystems. Because there are so many of these users locked into these ecosystems, it is fairly difficult for one ecosystem to take users from another.", "That is why we shouldn't expect as much penetration from say Apple Music into the Android ecosystem.", "We should also address the competition with Apple's services business. Most notably, Apple faces competition from the Swedish music streaming service Spotify (NYSE:", "). When evaluating the competitive threat that say Spotify would have against Apple Music's growth, we need to ask one question: Apple can do what Spotify does (music streaming), but can Spotify do what Apple does (everything else)? No. Apple can leverage all the other pieces of their ecosystem of hardware and software platforms to better the experience on individual software platforms.", "While Spotify will remain dominant in the Android market, Apple has hundreds of millions of iPhone owners yet to become Apple Music users. In addition, Apple could cut subscription prices to Apple Music, a move that would not meaningfully affect Apple's overall revenue but would allow them to take users away from the competition.", "Secondly, Apple has its \"other\" segment.

I believe a major part of the bullish momentum was supported by external factors like tax reform, weaker dollar from 2017 to mid-2018 and heavy buybacks.", "We should see a lower valuation for the stock as YoY comparisons become difficult. The management also needs sufficient time to build future growth verticals like streaming which is a very tough business with a number of strong challengers. The benefit of a lower stock price is that the company would be able to reduce the share count at a much faster pace. Investors looking for a good entry point should wait for the current correction to play out. An ideal entry point would be at EV/FCF ratio of 10-12 or $130 to $150 range.", "One of the direct benefits of a lower valuation multiple is the bigger share count reduction it can provide. A stock trading at $150 can allow the company to make 50% more buybacks compared to $230. In the last one year, Apple has reduced its share count by over 6% while putting $72 billion in this program. During this time, the stock price ranged from $155 to $230 with an average price around $190.", "If Apple continues to accelerate its buyback program while the stock price remains modest, we could see close to 10% reduction in share count in the current fiscal year. Apple is still generating loads of free cash flow. Hence, it does not have to dip into a lot of cash reserves. At the current pace, it would be another 3 to 4 years before the company reaches a cash neutral position. Since the start of the buyback program, Apple has reduced its share count by 23.3%.", "Another big advantage of a lower valuation multiple is the overall lower burden to meet aggressive targets. If Apple was trading at $250, it would need to hit home runs in all the major verticals. However, at $150, the management has a lot more room to build a long-term growth model, especially in new services it is exploring.", "The streaming business is very promising but it also has a number of challenges.

This would not only require heavy capital investment but also a bigger learning curve. It could take several quarters before an", "is perfected by Apple. During this time, there could be margin contraction due to investments in expensive streaming projects. A lower valuation multiple provides the company enough cushion to experiment while investing in future growth verticals.", "A common comment on Apple is that its valuation multiple is much lower than the broader S&P index. However, this would be a wrong comparison because the growth potential of every stock is different. A better option would be looking at Apple's valuation since the iPhone growth picked up.", "Fig: EV/FCF ratio and dividend yield of Apple in the past 10 years", "Apple has seen two negative swings in the last few years. One was in the 2012 cycle when Apple was forced to start a massive capital return program. Another was in early 2016 when the unit sales of iPhones started falling dramatically from the year-ago period. In the first swing, Apple's EV/FCF ratio went below 8 and in the second dip it went below 9.", "Apple will stop reporting the unit sales data of its products.

This trend was broken in the latest quarter. As lower-priced iPhone XR sales increase, there could be a further decline in margins.

At this point, the yield will also improve to over 2%. Value investors looking for a reasonable entry point should wait for the stock to complete the current correction.", "The current bearish sentiment in Apple's stock can last some time. As more analysts downgrade their ratings, Apple's stock will be under continuous pressure. The next cycle is not looking very promising as Apple would not have 5G capability while all the other major players will start launching their flagship devices on 5G. This can end up delaying the purchase of iPhones and further elongate the upgrade cycle of iPhones.", "Most of the analysts are having a US-centric view which gives a wrong picture of Apple's strength and pricing power. Many international regions are facing slowing economy, currency devaluation and also have much more vibrant competitive environment due to heavy presence of Chinese OEMs. Apple's stock could fall below $150 which would put it in the range of 10 to 12 times EV/FCF range with a dividend of over 2%.
