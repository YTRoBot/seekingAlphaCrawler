Institutions should continue buying NVDA."], "article_body": ["2018 has to be a fantastic year for the shareholders of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:", "), whose underdog image has finally been vindicated by its 170% revenue growth and 90% stock return. In contrast, AMD\u2019s arch rival Nvidia (NASDAQ:", ") had a lackluster 2018 stock performance of -25% after the first major negative revenue guidance. Ironically, both AMD and Nvidia were supposed to have been exposed to the same rise and fall of crypto-related demand. Yet, the market has reacted totally differently to each firm\u2019s recent, similar financial results. There have been many posts to explain the difference between the two companies. In this post, I looked at the difference from institutional investors\u2019 perspective.", "Since stock prices often measure the average sentiment, trading activities reflect the realization of sentiment. I tracked each stock\u2019s institutional ownership, because it represents institutional or large investors\u2019 actual investment decisions.", "AMD\u2019s price had a wild ride this year, going from $9 all the way to $35, and quickly correcting to $20. On the other hand, Nvidia just had a more than 45% correction immediately following its Q4 downside revenue guidance. As both stock prices had their share of excessive volatility, institutional ownership could provide a better indication of their intents. In Figure 1, I present AMD and Nvidia\u2019s institutional ownership as the percentage of the floats since October 2018.", "Since October 15th, it is clear that institutions decided to take a different path between AMD and Nvidia. Based on the most recent 13Fs, institutions have reduced their holdings of AMD from 75% to 68%, while Nvidia\u2019s institutions raise their stake from 76% to 78%.", "In other words, since mid-November, based on AMD\u2019s (Nvidia\u2019s) average price around $24 ($156) and 999.4 million (610.2 million) shares outstanding, institutions have sold $1.7 billion worth of AMD shares while bought $1.9 billion of Nvidia shares. While it is not clear if they sold AMD in order to buy NVDA, the similar dollar size of the trade suggests a distinct possibility of a dollar for dollar rotation between the two stocks by the institutions as a group. What would be even more interesting and informative is the intent behind institutional opposite investment decisions on NVDA and AMD.", "The first obvious rationale is that institutions traded on the changes in fundamentals, as both companies just experienced significant surprises in Q3 ERs. It is reasonable to assume that institutional investors, like any other investors, will rotate their portfolios based on the revised forward-looking financials. To test this argument, I lined up the institutional holdings and the forward revenue estimates over time. In Figure 4, it is clear that AMD\u2019s institutional ownership dropped while forward revenue did not change (in circle). In fact, Nvidia\u2019s institutional holding actually increased despite the concurrent downward revision of forward revenue (Figure 5 in circle). It seems safe to conclude that, at least for AMD and Nvidia in the recent period, institutional investors did not change their holdings based on the changes in forward financials.", "Since I managed to defeat my first intuition, I proceeded to examine the next likely reason that institutional investors may have traded for valuation. That is, they buy undervalued stocks and sell overvalued stocks. To test this possibility, I lined up the institutional ownership and the stock\u2019s mispricing at the time. (Mispricing is computed by the percentage difference between the actual stock price and analysts\u2019 mean target price.) In Figure 2, institutions appear to reduce (sell) their AMD holding before September when AMD became extremely overvalued (over 50%). The selling continued into November. Similarly, institutions started aggressively buying NVDA when its undervaluation exceeded 25% also in early November. The buying also continued into the undervaluation over 35%. In short, both cases demonstrated stronger evidence that institutions have traded for mispricing more than for fundamentals.", "It looks like institutional investors have recently made significant changes in their investments between AMD and Nvidia. As a group, the evidence suggests that they rotated out of AMD and into NVDA. The changes were significant enough to beg the question why they made the switch since both companies missed their earnings and lowered their Q4 revenue guidance. While Nvidia has lost over 40% accordingly, AMD\u2019s loss has been largely offset by the expected CPU (GPU) market share gains from Intel (NASDAQ:", ") (Nvidia) from the expected launch of 7nm chip. This is the reason I originally thought that institutional investors had adjusted their holdings pursuant to the difference in forward financials. However, the evidence does not bear out this conjecture.", "In the meantime, both stocks have had horrific runs in both directions lately. So the next logical guess is that institutions may have traded AMD and NVDA based on mispricing due to excessive volatility. In this case, there is more convincing evidence that institutions have bought more NVDA when it was significantly undervalued and sold AMD when it was significantly overvalued.", "If valuation was the reason for the institutions\u2019 trades, there is a silver lining for the serious market draw down in last few days. The current market correction will make the overvalued AMD fairly valued and the undervalued NVDA more undervalued. Institutions should stop selling AMD and keep buying NVDA for valuation.", "", ""], "image_urls": ["https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/12/6/47444632-1544081323398824.jpg"], "article_sentiment": 0.11683163902265027}

Whilst on the surface their current dividend yield of only 1.65% may not seem enticing, I feel it\u2019s far more important to focus on their free cash flow yield of 7.65%.

On the other hand Apple traded as low 9.93 in February 2016. What I'm focusing on is that in each of the previous downtrend, the P/E ratio moved below at least 12.0 each time which represented a bottom.

Let's go over why the iPhone X was able to drive units higher while simultaneously selling the X for $999+.", "There were a whole host of factors that led to iPhone revenues surging. The first factor was the iPhone 6. When the iPhone X was launched, on average, people would use their phones for two years before upgrading to a new iPhone. Two years after the hit revenue from the iPhone 6 was the iPhone X cycle. The iPhone 6 was a hit seller. Buyers of the iPhone 6 were looking to upgrade their phones. The $999 price was irrelevant to the buyers. Why? It could be because of two factors. Firstly, the way Apple unveiled the new iPhone X. Secondly, the iPhone X was a substantial step-up from the previous iPhone 7.", "On the first point, the iPhone X was debuted a full decade after the first iPhone (hence the name). In addition, Apple unveiled the iPhone X in a \"one more thing\" after releasing the iPhone 8, something that has spelled out significant hype in the past from the technological community. They were able to generate enormous hype around the new iPhone that may have helped bolster unit shipments.", "Secondly, Apple had strong technological innovation and design changes in the iPhone X cycle versus the iPhone 7. In addition, true to every product Apple builds, the iPhone X had simplicity in mind. Apple removed the home button, included new FaceID technology, upgraded their Bionic chip, created Portrait mode, improved their screen technology from an LCD screen to OLED. All in all, the iPhone X was a large performance enhancement from the previous iPhone 7.", "The combination of Apple's ability to hype its consumers with technological improvements and a change in the look and feel of an iPhone is what allowed it sell so well.", "(Source: Apple)", "Now, we are looking at the upgrade cycle going from the hit iPhone 6, to the more muted iPhone 6S and iPhone 7 lineup.

While 2019 will mark the beginning of the 5G rollout, Apple is holding off until 2020 to launch a 5G smartphone. Why? When a new technological standard is rolled out, the transition from the old standard (4G LTE) to the new standard (5G) isn't a smooth path.

Another theory with regards to Apple's 5G deployment or lack thereof is that Intel is coming in late.", "In my opinion, the performance tailwind coming from 5G will be substantial enough to drive significant hardware and software improvements to iPhones that re-excites Apple's loyal fan base into upgrading.", "On top of that, a refresh of an older yet popular phone like the iPhone SE could be a solid selling point in 2020.

Apple is still heavily built around the iPhone. Management, led primarily by CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri, disappointed me and several other followers of and investors in Apple. Why? After the Q4 results, management infamously announced that they would be pulling their reporting of unit shipments from future quarterly disclosures.", "While my fellow bulls have made the argument that Apple is doing this to change Wall Street's perception of what it means to be Apple, I believe that this move catastrophically dents investor confidence in management.", "Bulls will say that Apple moving to pull unit shipment data from releases is just to change the story around Apple from an iPhone company to a more enclosed software/hardware hybrid. This seems rational. Quarter after quarter, the headlines that dominate CNBC are talking about how iPhone missed expectations. Then, when you look at how badly Apple would miss, the margin would be small. After all, Apple did not provide guidance for unit shipments, making it the sell-side's job to look at the supply chain and give educated guesses on unit shipments. So, if Apple missed estimate by 1% or 2% on the shipments side, Wall Street would sell off the stock, and analysts would be swift to downgrade. If Apple forcibly removed reporting of unit sales, the Wall Street would be less focused on the iPhone and more focused on the overall picture at Apple. This would be a significant change in the Apple story and would theoretically reduce volatility in the stock.", "To the contrary, evidence is piling up showing a significant decline in shipments in fiscal Q1 of 2019. Apple's removing of unit disclosure was not upfront. Rather, it was out of the blue. Apple hadn't warned investors previously about pulling unit data and even painted a bright sky for iPhones this cycle. Not only that, but Apple waited to tell investors about them removing this data until the", "of the conference call.

The transparency shown, or lack thereof, is astonishing.", "While by no means am I saying Apple's management is terrible, management's removal of essential data about shipments casts an extremely negative light on the company and on management itself. In my opinion, this is just a big misstep on management's part.", "Since the beginning of Apple's existence, the company's revenue was primarily generated by hardware products. Product innovations like the Apple II, iPod, iPad, and the iPhone have all driven Apple to becoming one of the most relevant companies on earth. Hardware has been Apple's bread and butter since its founding and has driven Apple's financial performance.", "There are two problems with hardware, though. The first is that hardware sales do not generate recurring revenue, being subject to technological innovation cycle after cycle. The second problem is that the gross margins on hardware products are so much lower than software, as the cost of goods sold for a hardware product is so much greater than that of a software product. Even with Apple's use of outsource manufacturing and occasional vertical integration, Apple's hardware business will never have the margins of its software business.", "Apple's services and wearables segments, in particular, have been focused on by investors. These two segments are some of the fastest growing business segments within Apple. In Q4, Apple booked 17% Y/Y growth in its services segment and 31% in its \"other\" segment. Despite that tremendous growth, these two segments only make up 22% of Apple's overall revenue.", "If we look at Apple's services segment, we can see a distinguishable moat against competition. Platforms like Apple Pay, Apple Music, iCloud, and the App Store are all exclusive to the iOS ecosystem. Because Apple bundles a lot of these platforms into their hardware, they are able to better lock in their users into the Apple ecosystem. That is why there is such a division between iOS and Android. iOS and Android are not just providers of mobile operating systems. Within each of these systems, there are massive digital ecosystems. Because there are so many of these users locked into these ecosystems, it is fairly difficult for one ecosystem to take users from another.", "That is why we shouldn't expect as much penetration from say Apple Music into the Android ecosystem.", "We should also address the competition with Apple's services business. Most notably, Apple faces competition from the Swedish music streaming service Spotify (NYSE:", "). When evaluating the competitive threat that say Spotify would have against Apple Music's growth, we need to ask one question: Apple can do what Spotify does (music streaming), but can Spotify do what Apple does (everything else)? No. Apple can leverage all the other pieces of their ecosystem of hardware and software platforms to better the experience on individual software platforms.", "While Spotify will remain dominant in the Android market, Apple has hundreds of millions of iPhone owners yet to become Apple Music users. In addition, Apple could cut subscription prices to Apple Music, a move that would not meaningfully affect Apple's overall revenue but would allow them to take users away from the competition.", "Secondly, Apple has its \"other\" segment. This segment features products like the Apple Watch, AirPods, Apple TV, Beats, product accessories, and the HomePod smart speaker. The real area that I'm intently focused on within the Other segment is the Apple Watch.", "The most influential of these products is the Apple Watch. The watch operates in a market with only one true competitor in terms of size and relevance. That competitor would be Fitbit (NYSE:", "). Apple, by launching the Apple Watch, has launched a product that has sunk Fitbit's revenue growth and share price.", "While Apple did not singlehandedly wipe billions of dollars in value of Fitbit, the company's push into the smart watch market decimated Fitbit's competitive standing. As I already mentioned, Apple's ability to bundle products into its ecosystem is a massive competitive advantage. That is why Apple controls low market share in the overall smartphone market but commands the majority of the overall profits.", "Fitbit did not have a path to being competitive with Apple in the long term. Apple has now established a leading role in the smartwatch market. But this market has plenty of growth ahead. Why? Apple and others are now beginning to utilize and eventually monetize the health data collected on these smartwatches to better the customer experience. Digital health monitoring is arguably the next frontier in the healthcare and med-tech space. Companies like Apple are leading the charge. In the long term, we should see a continuation of growth in both units and revenue from the Apple Watch.", "Something that should be considered when looking at Apple is the probability that Apple will invest heavily in future innovation outside of their core business segments. Markets like autonomous driving, augmented reality, and original content could all be areas in which Apple decides to become a participant in. According to CNBC, Apple has ~5,000 people dedicated in a stealthy manner to an Apple autonomous driving project. Apple is heavily invested in augmented reality software and has a few augmented reality related patents on top of that. Apple is also set to open up an original content service for its users.
